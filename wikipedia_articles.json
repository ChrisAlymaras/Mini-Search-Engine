        "content": "\n The dot-com bubble (or dot-com boom) was a stock market bubble that ballooned during the late-1990s and peaked on Friday, March 10, 2000. This period of market growth coincided with the widespread adoption of the World Wide Web and the Internet, resulting in a dispensation of available venture capital and the rapid growth of valuations in new dot-com startups. Between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, investments in the NASDAQ composite stock market index rose by 800%, only to fall 78% from its peak by October 2002, giving up all its gains during the bubble.\n During the dot-com crash, many online shopping companies, notably Pets.com, Webvan, and Boo.com, as well as several communication companies, such as Worldcom, NorthPoint Communications, and Global Crossing, failed and shut down.[1][2] Others, like Lastminute.com, MP3.com and PeopleSound remained through its sale and buyers acquisition. Larger companies like Amazon and Cisco Systems lost large portions of their market capitalization, with Cisco losing 80% of its stock value.[2][3]\n Historically, the dot-com boom can be seen as similar to a number of other technology-inspired booms of the past, including railroads in the 1840s, automobiles in the early 20th century, radio in the 1920s, television in the 1940s, transistor electronics in the 1950s, computer time-sharing in the 1960s, and home computers and biotechnology in the 1980s.[4]\n Low interest rates in 1998–99 facilitated an increase in start-up companies.\n In 2000, the dot-com bubble burst, and many dot-com startups went out of business after burning through their venture capital and failing to become profitable.[5] However, many others, particularly online retailers like eBay and Amazon, blossomed and became highly profitable.[6][7] More conventional retailers found online merchandising to be a profitable additional source of revenue. While some online entertainment and news outlets failed when their seed capital ran out, others persisted and eventually became economically self-sufficient. Traditional media outlets (newspaper publishers, broadcasters and cablecasters in particular) also found the Web to be a useful and profitable additional channel for content distribution, and an additional means to generate advertising revenue. The sites that survived and eventually prospered after the bubble burst had two things in common: a sound business plan, and a niche in the marketplace that was, if not unique, particularly well-defined and well-served.[citation needed]\n In the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, telecommunications companies had a great deal of overcapacity as many Internet business clients went bust. That, plus ongoing investment in local cell infrastructure kept connectivity charges low, and helped to make high-speed Internet connectivity more affordable.[citation needed] During this time, a handful of companies found success developing business models that helped make the World Wide Web a more compelling experience. These include airline booking sites, Google's search engine and its profitable approach to keyword-based advertising,[8] as well as eBay's auction site[6] and Amazon.com's online department store.[7] The low price of reaching millions worldwide, and the possibility of selling to or hearing from those people at the same moment when they were reached, promised to overturn established business dogma in advertising, mail-order sales, customer relationship management, and many more areas. The web was a new killer app—it could bring together unrelated buyers and sellers in seamless and low-cost ways. Entrepreneurs around the world developed new business models, and ran to their nearest venture capitalist.[9] While some of the new entrepreneurs had experience in business and economics, the majority were simply people with ideas, and did not manage the capital influx prudently. Additionally, many dot-com business plans were predicated on the assumption that by using the Internet, they would bypass the distribution channels of existing businesses and therefore not have to compete with them; when the established businesses with strong existing brands developed their own Internet presence, these hopes were shattered, and the newcomers were left attempting to break into markets dominated by larger, more established businesses.[10]\n The dot-com bubble burst in March 2000, with the technology heavy NASDAQ Composite index peaking at 5,048.62 on March 10[11] (5,132.52 intraday), more than double its value just a year before. By 2001, the bubble's deflation was running full speed. A majority of the dot-coms had ceased trading, after having burnt through their venture capital and IPO capital, often without ever making a profit. But despite this, the Internet continued to grow, driven by commerce, ever greater amounts of online information, knowledge, social networking and access by mobile devices.[citation needed]\n The 1993 release of Mosaic and subsequent web browsers during the following years gave computer users access to the World Wide Web, popularizing use of the Internet.[12] Internet use increased as a result of the reduction of the \"digital divide\" and advances in connectivity, uses of the Internet, and computer education. Between 1990 and 1997, the percentage of households in the United States owning computers increased from 15% to 35% as computer ownership progressed from a luxury to a necessity.[13] This marked the shift to the Information Age, an economy based on information technology, and many new companies were founded.\n At the same time, a decline in interest rates increased the availability of capital.[14] The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which lowered the top marginal capital gains tax in the United States, also made people more willing to make more speculative investments.[15] Alan Greenspan, then-Chair of the Federal Reserve, allegedly fueled investments in the stock market by putting a positive spin on stock valuations.[16] The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was expected to result in many new technologies from which many people wanted to profit.[17]\n As a result of these factors, many investors were eager to invest, at any valuation, in any dot-com company, especially if it had one of the Internet-related prefixes or a \".com\" suffix in its name. Venture capital was easy to raise. Investment banks, which profited significantly from initial public offerings (IPO), fueled speculation and encouraged investment in technology.[18] A combination of rapidly increasing stock prices in the quaternary sector of the economy and confidence that the companies would turn future profits created an environment in which many investors were willing to overlook traditional metrics, such as the price–earnings ratio, and base confidence on technological advancements, leading to a stock market bubble.[16] Between 1995 and 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%. It reached a price–earnings ratio of 200, dwarfing the peak price–earnings ratio of 80 for the Japanese Nikkei 225 during the Japanese asset price bubble of 1991.[16] In 1999, shares of Qualcomm rose in value by 2,619%, 12 other large-cap stocks each rose over 1,000% in value, and seven additional large-cap stocks each rose over 900% in value. Even though the Nasdaq Composite rose 85.6% and the S&P 500 rose 19.5% in 1999, more stocks fell in value than rose in value as investors sold stocks in slower growing companies to invest in Internet stocks.[19]\n An unprecedented amount of personal investing occurred during the boom and stories of people quitting their jobs to trade on the financial market were common.[20] The news media took advantage of the public's desire to invest in the stock market; an article in The Wall Street Journal suggested that investors \"re-think\" the \"quaint idea\" of profits,[21] and CNBC reported on the stock market with the same level of suspense as many networks provided to the broadcasting of sports events.[16][22]\n At the height of the boom, it was possible for a promising dot-com company to become a public company via an IPO and raise a substantial amount of money even if it had never made a profit—or, in some cases, realized any material revenue or even have a finished product. People who received employee stock options became instant paper millionaires when their companies executed IPOs; however, most employees were barred from selling shares immediately due to lock-up periods.[18][page needed] The most successful entrepreneurs, such as Mark Cuban, sold their shares or entered into hedges to protect their gains. Sir John Templeton successfully shorted many dot-com stocks at the peak of the bubble during what he called \"temporary insanity\" and a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\". He shorted stocks just before the expiration of lockup periods ending six months after initial public offerings, correctly anticipating many dot-com company executives would sell shares as soon as possible, and that large-scale selling would force down share prices.[23][24]\n Most dot-com companies incurred net operating losses as they spent heavily on advertising and promotions to harness network effects to build market share or mind share as fast as possible, using the mottos \"get big fast\" and \"get large or get lost\". These companies offered their services or products for free or at a discount with the expectation that they could build enough brand awareness to charge profitable rates for their services in the future.[25][26]\n The \"growth over profits\" mentality and the aura of \"new economy\" invincibility led some companies to engage in lavish spending on elaborate business facilities and luxury vacations for employees. Upon the launch of a new product or website, a company would organize an expensive event called a dot-com party.[27][28]\n In the five years after the American Telecommunications Act of 1996 went into effect, telecommunications equipment companies invested more than $500 billion, mostly financed with debt, into laying fiber optic cable, adding new switches, and building wireless networks.[17] In many areas, such as the Dulles Technology Corridor in Virginia, governments funded technology infrastructure and created favorable business and tax law to encourage companies to expand.[29] The growth in capacity vastly outstripped the growth in demand.[17] Spectrum auctions for 3G in the United Kingdom in April 2000, led by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, raised £22.5 billion.[30] In Germany, in August 2000, the auctions raised £30 billion.[31][32] A 3G spectrum auction in the United States in 1999 had to be re-run when the winners defaulted on their bids of $4 billion. The re-auction netted 10% of the original sales prices.[33][34] When financing became difficult to obtain as the bubble burst, high debt ratios of some companies led to a number of bankruptcies.[35] Bond investors recovered just over 20% of their investments.[36] However, several telecom executives sold stock before the crash including Philip Anschutz, who reaped $1.9 billion, Joseph Nacchio, who reaped $248 million, and Gary Winnick, who sold $748 million worth of shares.[37]\n Nearing the turn of the 2000s, spending on technology was volatile as companies prepared for the Year 2000 problem.  There were concerns that computer systems would have trouble changing their clock and calendar systems from 1999 to 2000 which might trigger wider social or economic problems, but there was virtually no impact or disruption due to adequate preparation.[38] Spending on marketing also reached new heights for the sector: Two dot-com companies purchased ad spots for Super Bowl XXXIII, and 17 dot-com companies bought ad spots the following year for Super Bowl XXXIV.[39]\n On January 10, 2000, America Online, led by Steve Case and Ted Leonsis, announced a merger with Time Warner, led by Gerald M. Levin. The merger was the largest to date and was questioned by many analysts.[40] Then, on January 30, 2000, 12 ads of the 61 ads for Super Bowl XXXIV were purchased by dot-coms (sources state ranges from 12 up to 19 companies depending on the definition of dot-com company). At that time, the cost for a 30-second commercial was between $1.9 million and $2.2 million.[41][42]\n Meanwhile, Alan Greenspan, then Chair of the Federal Reserve, raised interest rates several times; these actions were believed by many[weasel words] to have caused the bursting of the dot-com bubble. According to Paul Krugman, however, \"he didn't raise interest rates to curb the market's enthusiasm; he didn't even seek to impose margin requirements on stock market investors. Instead, [it is alleged] he waited until the bubble burst, as it did in 2000, then tried to clean up the mess afterward\".[43] Finance author and commentator E. Ray Canterbery agreed with Krugman's criticism.[44]\n On Friday March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ Composite stock market index peaked at 5,048.62.[45] However, on March 13, 2000, news that Japan had once again entered a recession triggered a global sell off that disproportionately affected technology stocks.[46] Soon after, Yahoo! and eBay ended merger talks and the Nasdaq fell 2.6%, but the S&P 500 rose 2.4% as investors shifted from strong performing technology stocks to poor performing established stocks.[47]\n On March 20, 2000, Barron's featured a cover article titled \"Burning Up; Warning: Internet companies are running out of cash—fast\", which predicted the imminent bankruptcy of many Internet companies.[48] This led many people to rethink their investments. That same day, MicroStrategy announced a revenue restatement due to aggressive accounting practices. Its stock price, which had risen from $7 per share to as high as $333 per share in a year, fell $140 per share, or 62%, in a day.[49] The next day, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates, leading to an inverted yield curve, although stocks rallied temporarily.[50]\n Tangentially to all of speculation, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson issued his conclusions of law in the case of United States v. Microsoft Corp. (2001) and ruled that Microsoft was guilty of monopolization and tying in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. This led to a one-day 15% decline in the value of shares in Microsoft and a 350-point, or 8%, drop in the value of the Nasdaq. Many people saw the legal actions as bad for technology in general.[51] That same day, Bloomberg News published a widely read article that stated: \"It's time, at last, to pay attention to the numbers\".[52]\n On Friday, April 14, 2000, the Nasdaq Composite index fell 9%, ending a week in which it fell 25%. Investors were forced to sell stocks ahead of Tax Day, the due date to pay taxes on gains realized in the previous year.[53] By June 2000, dot-com companies were forced to reevaluate their spending on advertising campaigns.[54] On November 9, 2000, Pets.com, a much-hyped company that had backing from Amazon.com, went out of business only nine months after completing its IPO.[55][56] By that time, most Internet stocks had declined in value by 75% from their highs, wiping out $1.755 trillion in value.[57] In January 2001, just three dot-com companies bought advertising spots during Super Bowl XXXV.[58] The September 11 attacks accelerated the stock-market drop.[59] Investor confidence was further eroded by several accounting scandals and the resulting bankruptcies, including the Enron scandal in October 2001, the WorldCom scandal in June 2002,[60] and the Adelphia Communications Corporation scandal in July 2002.[61]\n By the end of the stock market downturn of 2002, stocks had lost $5 trillion in market capitalization since the peak.[62] At its trough on October 9, 2002, the NASDAQ-100 had dropped to 1,114, down 78% from its peak.[63][64]\n After venture capital was no longer available, the operational mentality of executives and investors completely changed. A dot-com company's lifespan was measured by its burn rate, the rate at which it spent its existing capital. Many dot-com companies ran out of capital and went through liquidation. Supporting industries, such as advertising and shipping, scaled back their operations as demand for services fell. However, many companies were able to endure the crash; 48% of dot-com companies survived through 2004, albeit at lower valuations.[25]\n Several companies and their executives, including Bernard Ebbers, Jeffrey Skilling, and Kenneth Lay, were accused or convicted of fraud for misusing shareholders' money, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission levied large fines against investment firms including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch for misleading investors.[65]\n After suffering losses, retail investors transitioned their investment portfolios to more cautious positions.[66] Popular Internet forums that focused on high tech stocks, such as Silicon Investor, Yahoo! Finance, and The Motley Fool declined in use significantly.[67]\n Layoffs of programmers resulted in a general glut in the job market. University enrollment for computer-related degrees dropped noticeably.[68][69] Aeron chairs, which retailed for $1,100 each, were liquidated en masse.[70]\n As growth in the technology sector stabilized, companies consolidated; some, such as Amazon.com, eBay, Nvidia and Google gained market share and came to dominate their respective fields. The most valuable public companies are now generally in the technology sector.[citation needed]\n In a 2015 book, venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who funded many dot-com companies and lost 90% of his net worth when the bubble burst, said about the dot-com bubble:\n A friend of mine has a great line. He says \"Nothing important has ever been built without irrational exuberance.\" Meaning that you need some of this mania to cause investors to open up their pocketbooks and finance the building of the railroads or the automobile or aerospace industry or whatever. And in this case, much of the capital invested was lost, but also much of it was invested in a very high throughput backbone for the Internet, and lots of software that works, and databases and server structure. All that stuff has allowed what we have today, which has changed all our lives... that's what all this speculative mania built.[71]",

        "title": "Real estate investment trust",
        "content": "A real estate investment trust (REIT, pronounced \"reet\"[1]) is a company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate. REITs own many types of commercial real estate, including office and apartment buildings, studios, warehouses, hospitals, shopping centers, hotels and commercial forests.[2] Some REITs engage in financing real estate. REITs act as a bridge between the worlds of housing and urban development on one hand, and institutional investors and financial markets on the other. They are typically categorized into commercial REITs (C-REITs) and residential REITs (R-REITs), with the latter focusing on housing assets such as apartments and single-family homes.[3]\n Most countries' laws on REITs entitle a real estate company to pay less in corporation tax and capital gains tax.[4] REITs have been criticised as enabling speculation on housing, and reducing housing affordability, without increasing finance for building.[5]\n REITs can be publicly traded on major exchanges, publicly registered but non-listed, or private.[6][7] The two main types of REITs are equity REITs[8] and mortgage REITs (mREITs).[9] In November 2014, equity REITs were recognized as a distinct asset class[10] in the Global Industry Classification Standard by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI. The key statistics to examine the financial position and operation of a REIT include net asset value (NAV), funds from operations (FFO), and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO).[11]\n REITs were created in the United States after President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed Public Law 86-779, sometimes called the Cigar Excise Tax Extension of 1960.[12][13] The law was enacted to allow all investors to invest in large-scale, diversified portfolios of income-producing real estate in the same way they typically invest in other asset classes – through the purchase and sale of liquid securities. The first REIT was American Realty Trust founded by Thomas J. Broyhill, cousin of Virginia U.S. Congressman Joel Broyhill in 1961[14] who pushed for the creation under Eisenhower.\n As of 2021, at least 39 countries around the world have established REITs.[15] A comprehensive index for the REIT and the global listed property market is the FTSE EPRA/Nareit Global Real Estate Index Series, which was created jointly in October 2001 by the index provider FTSE Group, Nareit and the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA).[16][17] As of 29 January 2021, the global index included 490 stock exchange listed real estate companies from 39 countries representing an equity market capitalization of about $1.7 trillion.[18]\n Around the time of their creation in 1960, the first REITs primarily consisted of mortgage companies. The industry experienced significant expansion in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The growth primarily resulted from the increased use of mREITs in land development and construction deals. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 authorized REITs to be established as corporations in addition to business trusts.\n The Tax Reform Act of 1986 also impacted REITs. The legislation included new rules designed to prevent taxpayers from using partnerships to shelter their earnings from other sources. Three years later, REITs witnessed significant losses in the stock market.\n Retail REIT Taubman Centers Inc. launched the modern era of REITs in 1992 with its creation of the UPREIT. In an UPREIT, the parties of an existing partnership and a REIT become partners in a new \"operating partnership\". The REIT typically is the general partner and the majority owner of the operating partnership units, and the partners who contributed properties have the right to exchange their operating partnership units for REIT shares or cash. The industry struggled during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, after which listed REITs responded by deleveraging (paying off debt) and re-equitizing (selling stock to get cash) their balance sheets. Listed REITs and REOCs raised $37.5 billion in 91 secondary equity offerings, nine IPOs and 37 unsecured debt offerings as investors continued to act favorably to companies strengthening their balance sheets following the credit crisis.\n REIT dividends have a 100 percent payout ratio for all income at lower rates. This inhibits the internal growth of the REIT and causes investors to not tolerate low or non-existent yields as the interest rates are more sensitive.[19] Economic climates characterized by rising interest rates can cause a net negative effect on REIT shares.[20] The dividends paid by REITs look less attractive when compared to bonds that have\nincreasing coupon rates.[21] Also, when investors shy away from REITs, it makes it\ndifficult for management to raise additional funds to acquire more property.[22]\n The first REIT in Kenya was approved by the Capital Markets Authority in October 2015. The REIT is issued by Stanlib Kenya under the name Fahari I-Reit scheme. \nThe REIT scheme will provide unit holders stable cash inflows from the income generating real estate properties.\nThe unrestricted IPO will be listed on the main investment market segment of the Nairobi Securities Exchange.[23]\n REITs have been in existence in Ghana since 1994. The Home Finance Company, now HFC Bank, established the first REIT in Ghana in August 1994. HFC Bank has been at the forefront of mortgage financing in Ghana since 1993. It has used various collective investment schemes as well as corporate bonds to finance its mortgage lending activities. Collective Investment Schemes, of which REITs are a part, are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Ghana.\n In 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued the first set of guidelines for the registration and issuance of requirements for the operation of REITs in Nigeria as detailed in the Investment and Securities Act (ISA). The first REIT, the N50 billion Union Homes Hybrid Real Estate Investment Trust, was launched in September 2008. In November 2015 there were three listed REITS on the Nigerian Stock Exchange:[24] Skye Shelter Fund, Union Home and UPDC. A Haldane McCall REIT did not list after failing to reach the minimum 50% subscription in a January 2015 initial public offer amid poor market prospects.[25]\n By October 2015 there were 33 South African REITS and three non-South African REITs listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, according to the SA REIT Association,[26] which said market capitalization was more than R455 billion.\n Commonly referred to as Real Estate Investment Fund, the regulations were launched in July 2006 by the Saudi Capital Market Authority, The regulation did not allow the funds to be traded in the stock market and forced all funds to be structured by a licensed Investment companies by CMA with a presence of a real estate developer and some other key persons.[27]\n The REIT legislation was introduced by Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) to promote the\ndevelopment of REIT's in the UAE by passing The Investment Trust Law No.5 that went into effect\non August 6, 2006.[citation needed]   This restricts all 'true' REIT structures to be domiciled within the DIFC.  The first REIT license to be issued will be backed by Dubai Islamic Bank with a REIT named 'Emirates REIT' headed up by the dot com entrepreneur, Sylvain Vieujot.[citation needed]\n The issue is that DIFC domiciled REITs cannot acquire non-Freezone assets within the Emirate of Dubai.  The only federally approved Freezone within the UAE is the DIFC itself so therefore any properties outside this zone are purchasable by local Gulf (GCC) passport holders only. However, through a collaboration with local authorities, Emirates REIT has been able to establish a platform enabling it to purchase properties anywhere in Dubai given a minimum of 51% of local ownership of its shares. This allows the company to diversify its portfolio with an efficient revenue generating mix of properties in the prime locations of Dubai. Emirates REIT is the first REIT established within the United Arab Emirates. It is also the first REIT listed on NASDAQ Dubai and one of the five Shari'a compliant REIT in the world with a focus on Income-producing assets.\n Emirates REIT has a portfolio of over US$575.3 million consisting of a total of seven properties primarily focused on commercial and office space as of December 2014. It has had substantial growth over the last four years.\n The REIT concept was launched in Australia in 1971. General Property Trust was the first Australian real estate investment trust (LPT) on the Australian stock exchanges (now the Australian Securities Exchange).  REITs which are listed on an exchange were known as Listed Property Trusts (LPTs) until March 2008, distinguishing them from private REITs which are known in Australia as Unlisted Property Trusts.  They have since been renamed Australian Real Estate Investment Trusts (A-REITs) in line with international practice.[28]\n REITs have shown numerous benefits over direct investment including lower tax rates and increased liquidity. There are now more than 70 A-REITs listed on the ASX, with market capitalization in excess of A$100bn.[28]\n Australia is also receiving growing recognition as having the world's largest REITs market outside the United States. More than 12 percent of global listed property trusts can be found on the ASX.[29]\n REITs have been in existence in Hong Kong since 2005, when The Link REIT was launched by the Hong Kong Housing Authority on behalf of the Hong Kong Government. Since 2005, there have been seven REIT listings as at July 2007, most of which, including Sunlight REIT have not enjoyed success because of low yield. Except for The Link and Regal Real Estate Investment Trust, share prices of all but one are significantly below the initial public offering (IPO) price. Hong Kong issuers' use of financial engineering (interest rate swaps) to improve initial yields has also been cited as having reduced investors' interest[30]\n As of July 2012 there are nine REITs listed with a total market capitalisation of approximately €15 billion which amounts to almost 2% of the total global REIT market capitalisation. Two out of the nine listed REITs are also included in the EPRA index, an index published by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA). The current top five REITs in Hong Kong are The Link REIT with a total market capitalisation of €8 billion, Hui Xian REIT with a total market capitalisation of €2.3 billion, Champion REIT with a total market capitalisation of €1.8 billion, Fortune REIT with a total market capitalisation of €1 billion and Real Estate[clarify] with a total market capitalisation of €700 million.[31]\n As of August 2014, India approved creation of real estate investment trusts in the country.[32] Indian REITs (country specific/generic version I-REITs) will help individual investors enjoy the benefits of owning an interest in the securitised real estate market. The greatest benefit will be that of fast and easy liquidation of investments in the real estate market unlike the traditional way of disposing of real estate. The government and Securities and Exchange Board of India through various notifications is in the process of making it easier to invest in real estate in India directly and indirectly through foreign direct investment, through listed real estate companies and mutual funds. In the budget of 2014, finance minister Arun Jaitley has introduced a law for setting up of REITs.[33]\nAs in 2021, there are three REITs listed in National Stock Exchange of India. These are Embassy, Mindspace and Brookfields. Overall, the shareholding of Indian REITs is skewed towards institutional investors (mostly FPIs), with very minimal contribution from retail investors.[34]\n CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) and NDRC (National Development and Reform Commission) jointly announced the start of pilot projects in REITs on April 30, 2020. This official announcement represents the beginning of REITs in mainland China.\n As of March 14, 2024, the landscape of China's Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) saw a significant advancement with the listing of Huaxia Jinmao Commercial REITs (508017)[35] and Jiashi Wumei Consumer REITs (508011)[36] on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on March 12, followed by Huaxia China Resources Commercial REITs (180601)[37] on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on March 14.\n According to statistics from the Shanghai Stock Exchange, listing these two consumer infrastructure REITs has increased the total number of listed REITs to 23, with an issuance scale approaching 80 billion yuan.[38] The Shenzhen Stock Exchange has reported that the funds raised by infrastructure REITs successfully listed on their exchange have surpassed 32 billion yuan. These projects encompass various asset types, including industrial parks, toll roads, storage logistics, ecological protection, clean energy, affordable rental housing, and consumer infrastructure. The products have been operating smoothly, with active investor participation, gradually enhancing market functions, thereby creating significant scale and demonstration effects.[38]\n Japan permitted the establishment of REITs in December 2001. J-REIT securities are traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange among other exchanges in Japan.[39]\n A J-REIT (a listed real estate investment trust) is strictly regulated under the Law concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Companies (LITIC) and established as an investment company under the LITIC.[40]\n In addition to REITs, Japanese law also provides for a parallel system of special purpose companies which can be used for the securitization of particular properties on the private placement basis. REIT shares targeted in 2016 accounted for 7 percent of the United States market, which were subsequently sold for less than half of the initial value at $31 billion.[41]\n The Bursa Malaysia has 18 REIT listed with five Islamic REITS (shariah compliant – according to Islamic investment compliance).\n Dana Investasi Real Estat Berbentuk Kontrak Investasi Kolektif (DIREs) have lacked popularity because of high sale tax and double taxation.[42] Until 2016, only one DIRE was established, which was in 2012. However, tax incentives plans demonstrate an  intention of policymakers and lawmakers to boost the competitiveness of the market, and to encourage DIREs to be listed domestically.\n The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan is in the process of implementing a REIT regulatory framework that will allow full foreign ownership, free movement of capital and unrestricted repatriation of profits. It will curb speculation in Pakistani real estate markets and gives access to small investors who want to diversify into real estate. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan is proposing a regulatory framework similar to that of Singapore and Hong Kong.[citation needed]\n The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan expected that about six REITs would be licensed within the first year, mainly large asset management companies. Pakistan has seen an outflow of investments by foreign real estate development companies, mostly based in Malaysia and Dubai.[43]\n SECP has issued licenses to four parties namely, Arif Habib REIT Management Company, AKD REIT Management Company, Eden Developers REIT Management Company and SB Global REIT Management Company.\n The legal framework enabling the establishment of REITs in the Philippines have been in place after the Real Estate Investment Trust Act of 2009 (Republic Act No. 9856) passed into law on December 17, 2009. Its Implementing Rules and Regulations were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2010. However, it failed to attract investors due to its restrictive tax policies and high friction cost.[44]\n Regulations on REITs was relaxed in January 2020[45] which led to the establishment of the first REIT in the country, AREIT Inc. of Ayala Land which had its public offering in August of the same year.[46] However foreign investors still have poor reception towards REITs during that year when there was also a prevailing COVID-19 pandemic.[45]\n Commonly referred to as S-REITs, there are more than 40 REITs listed on the Singapore Exchange,[47] with the latest REIT, Cromwell European REIT, listed on 30 November 2017. The first one to be set up being CapitaMall Trust[48][non-primary source needed] in July 2002. They represent a range of property sectors including retail, office, industrial, hospitality and residential. S-REITs hold a variety of properties in countries including Japan, China, Indonesia and Hong Kong, in addition to local properties.[49][50] In recent years, foreign assets listing on the Singapore Exchange has grown to overtake those traditional listing with local assets.\n S-REITs are regulated as Collective Investment Schemes under the Monetary Authority of Singapore's Code on Collective Investment Schemes,[51] or alternatively as Business Trusts.[52]\n Some of the regulations that S-REITs have to adhere to includes:[53]\n S-REITs benefit from tax advantaged status where the tax is payable only at the investor level and not at the REITs level. In addition to REITs, there are ten Business Trusts (\"BTs\") (similar to REITs but may hold assets that are not conventional and are not subjected to stringent rules as compared to SREITs), and six Stapled Instruments (composed of a stapled Business Trust Unit and a REIT unit), which are listed on the Singapore Exchange. The total market capitalisation of the listed Trust on Singapore Exchange approximate SGD 100 billion (as at 30 Nov 17).\n The Securities and Exchange Commission created regulations to establish REITs as an investment vehicle in late 2012, opening the doors for the first REITs to be listed in 2013.[54] There are at least two tens of REITS.[55] Introduced in 2014 to replace the Property Funds for Public Offering (PFPO) scheme, REITs have gained popularity, and the total market capitalisation has reached THB 85 billion across two million square metres of assets.[56]\n On 1 August 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) announced that REITS will be introduced as an extension of the current Unit Trust Code and the new Rules, which came into effect from 31 July 2020 is in the form of a Gazette Notification published by the SEC. These Rules which are comprehensive, will govern the setting up of and the conduct of a Sri Lankan REITs. Specific provisions have been included for the verification of title and valuation of property that will form part of the assets of the REIT. Amongst the requirements is the mandatory distribution of approximately 90% of income to the unit holders, which is currently not a requirement for any of the listed entities. Further, due to the availability of the tax pass through mechanism to Unit Trusts, REITs also could benefit to be a viable business concept to Sri Lanka that will open new horizons for entrepreneurs to take the real estate industry to greater heights.\n Bernheim Comofi (now AG Real Estate) introduced Belgian REITs in 1995 with the constitution of Befimmo. Others REITs in Belgium include Cofinimmo and Ascensio.[57]\n REITs were introduced in Bulgaria in 2004 with the Special Purpose Investment Companies Act. They are pass-through entities for corporate income tax purposes (i.e., they are not subject to corporate income-tax), but are subject to numerous restrictions.[58]\n Finnish REITs were established in 2010, when the Finnish parliament passed \"the tax exemption law\" (Laki eräiden asuntojen vuokraustoimintaa harjoittavien osakeyhtiöiden verohuojennuksesta, 299/2009).[59] Together with the \"Law on Real Estate Funds\" (Kiinteistörahastolaki, 1173–1997)[60] it enables the existence of tax-efficient residential REITs.\n Qualifications\n As of 2018[update] Orava Residential REIT is the only REIT in Finland.[61]\n The French acronyms for REIT are SIIC (publicly listed), contrary to SCPI and OCPI (which are two other kinds of real-estate trusts not publicly listed). In France, Unibail-Rodamco is the largest SIIC.[62] Gecina is the second-largest publicly traded property company in France, with the third-highest asset value among European REITs.[63][64]\n Germany planned to introduce REITs in order to create a new type of real estate investment vehicle. The Government feared that failing to introduce REITs in Germany would result in a significant loss of investment capital to other countries.[citation needed]  Nonetheless, there still[when?] is political resistance to these plans, especially from the Social Democratic Party.[citation needed]\n In June 2006 the ministry of finance announced that they planned  to introduce REITs in 2007.  The legal details seem to adopt much of the British REIT regulation.\n A law concerning REITs was enacted 1 June 2007, effective retroactively to 1 January 2007:[65]\n The German public real-estate sector accounts for 0.21% of the total global REIT market capitalization. Three out of the four G-REITS are represented in the EPRA index, an index managed by the European Public Real Estate Association (EPRA).[67]\n The 2013 Finance Act contained provisions for creating REIT structures in Ireland.[68] Irish based REITs include Hibernia REIT, Green REIT, Yew Grove REIT and IRES REIT.[69]\n Created in 2009, similar to British REITs, the SOCIMI (Sociedad cotizada de Capital Inmobiliario) boosted after a policy of fiscal incentives to help recover the biggest home prices crisis in Spain, in 2013.[70] There are more than 70 REITS in Spain, but the liquidity is low and the holding period is large.[70]\n The legislation laying out the rules for REITs in the United Kingdom was enacted in the Finance Act 2006 (now see the Corporation Tax Act 2010 sections 518 to 609) and came into effect in January 2007 when nine UK property-companies converted to REIT status, including five FTSE 100 members at that time: British Land, Hammerson, Landsec, Liberty International and Slough Estates. The other four companies were Brixton (now known as \"SEGRO\"), Great Portland Estates, Primary Health Properties and Workspace Group.[71]\n British REITs have to distribute 90% of their income to investors. They must be a close-ended investment trust and be UK-resident and publicly listed on a stock exchange.[72] The EPRA in Brussels each year publishes a breakdown of the UK REIT structure requirements.[73]\n To support the introduction of REITs in the UK, several commercial property and financial-services companies formed the REITs and Quoted Property Group. Other key bodies involved include the London Stock Exchange the British Property Federation and Reita. The Reita campaign was launched on 16 August 2006 by the REITs and Quoted Property Group in order to provide a source of information on REITs, quoted property and related investment-funds. Reita aims to raise awareness and understanding of REITs and of investment in quoted property companies. It does this primarily through its portal www.reita.org, providing knowledge, education and tools for financial advisers and investors.[74]\n Doug Naismith, managing director of European Personal Investments for Fidelity International, said in 2011: \"As existing markets expand and REIT-like structures are introduced in more countries, we expect to see the overall market grow by some ten percent per annum over the next five years, taking the market to $1 trillion by 2010.\"[75]\n The Finance Act 2012 brought five main changes to the REIT regime in the UK: \n Boyd Carson of Sapphire Capital Partners commented that \"the most important of these advantages is the ability for REITs to be listed on the AIM and the abolition of the 2% entry charge to the regime is also a significant step forward.\"[77] However, \"UK-REITs are still not as cash driven as the market would likely prefer\".[78]\n REITs were introduced in Brazil in 1993 by the law 8668–93 and initially ruled by the instruction 205/94 and, nowadays, by instruction 472/08[79] from CVM (Comissão de Valores Mobiliários - which is the Brazilian equivalent of SEC). Locally they are described as \"FII\"s or \"Fundos de Investimento Imobiliário\".  FII's dividends have been free of taxes for personal[80] investors (not companies) since 2006, but only for the funds which have at least 50 investors and that are publicly traded in the stock market.[81] FIIs, referred to as \"REIT\" to correspond with the similar investment vehicle in the US, have been used either to own and operate independent property investments, associated with a single property[82] or part property, or to own several real properties (multiple properties) funded through the capital markets.[citation needed][83]\n Canadian REITs were established in 1993.  They are required to be configured as trusts and are not taxed if they distribute their net taxable income to shareholders. REITs have been excluded from the income trust tax legislation passed in the 2007 budget by the Conservative government.  Many Canadian REITs have limited liability.[84] On December 16, 2010, the Department of Finance proposed amendments to the rules defining \"Qualifying REITs\" for Canadian tax purposes. As a result, \"Qualifying REITs\" are exempt from the new entity-level, \"specified investment flow-through\" (SIFT) tax that all publicly traded income trusts and partnerships are paying as of January 1, 2011.[85]\n Mexico has passed legislation to allow for the equivalent of REITs, known as FIBRAs[86] (Fideicomiso de Infraestructura y Bienes Raíces),[87] to be traded in the Mexican Stock Exchange. Like REITs legislation in other countries, companies must qualify as a FIBRA by complying with the following rules:[88]\n The first Mexican REIT was launched in 2011 and is called FIBRA UNO.[89] \nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Mexican REITs debuted in March 2011 \"after government regulatory changes made the structure possible. Fibras offered investors an easy way to own Mexican real estate and pick up an attractive dividend at the same time. Like U.S. REITs, Fibras avoid paying corporate taxes as long as they distribute at least 95% of their income to shareholders as dividends.\"[87]\n The U.S. Congress enacted the law providing for REITs in 1960.[90] The law was intended to provide a real estate investment structure similar to the one that mutual funds provide for investment in stocks.[91] REITs are strong income vehicles because, to avoid incurring liability for U.S. federal income tax, REITs generally must pay out an amount equal to at least 90 percent of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.[6]\n From 2008 to 2011, REITs faced challenges from both a slowing United States economy and the Great Recession.[92]\n For the five-year period ending in 2019, the S&P 500 index, an index of stocks for US large cap companies, returned an annualized 12.5% compared with an annualized return of 9.0% for the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs index. However, for the years 1972-2019 the total annualized returns were 12.1% for the S&P 500 versus 13.3% for the FTSE NAREIT index.[93] There are more than 190 public REITs listed on exchanges in the United States.[94]\n Under U.S. Federal income tax law, a REIT is \"any corporation, trust or association that acts as an investment agent specializing in real estate and real estate mortgages\" under Internal Revenue Code section 856.[95] The rules for federal income taxation of REITs are found primarily in Part II (sections 856 through 859) of Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. Because a REIT is entitled to deduct dividends paid to its owners (commonly referred to as shareholders), a REIT may avoid incurring all or part of its liabilities for U.S. federal income tax. To qualify as a REIT, an organization makes an \"election\" to do so by filing a Form 1120-REIT with the Internal Revenue Service, and by meeting certain other requirements. The purpose of this designation is to reduce or eliminate corporate tax, thus avoiding double taxation of owner income. In return, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income into the hands of investors. The REIT structure was designed to provide a real estate investment structure similar to the structure mutual funds provide for investment in stocks.[91]\n In the United States, a REIT is a company that owns, and in most cases operates, income-producing real estate. Some REITs finance real estate. To be a REIT, a company must distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends.[96]\n To qualify as a REIT under U.S. tax rules, a company must:\n",

        "title": "2007–2008 financial crisis",
        "content": "\n The 2007–2008 financial crisis, or the global financial crisis (GFC), was the most severe worldwide economic crisis since the 1929 Wall Street crash that began the Great Depression. Causes of the crisis included predatory lending in the form of subprime mortgages to low-income homebuyers and a resulting housing bubble, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,[1] and lack of regulatory oversight, which culminated in a \"perfect storm\" that triggered the Great Recession, which lasted from late 2007 to mid-2009. The financial crisis began in early 2007, as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) tied to U.S. real estate, as well as a vast web of derivatives linked to those MBS, collapsed in value. Financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage,[2] reaching a climax with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, and a subsequent international banking crisis.[3]\n The prerequisites for the crisis were complex.[4][5][6] During the 1990s, the U.S. Congress had passed legislation intended to expand affordable housing through looser financing.[7] In 1999, parts of the Glass–Steagall legislation (passed in 1933) were repealed, permitting institutions to mix low-risk operations, such as commercial banking and insurance, with higher-risk operations such as investment banking and proprietary trading.[8] As the Federal Reserve (\"Fed\") lowered the federal funds rate from 2000 to 2003, institutions increasingly targeted low-income homebuyers, largely belonging to racial minorities, with high-risk loans;[9] this development went unattended by regulators.[10] As interest rates rose from 2004 to 2006, the cost of mortgages rose and the demand for housing fell, causing property values to decline. In early 2007, as more U.S. mortgage holders began defaulting on their repayments, subprime lenders went bankrupt, culminating in April with the bankruptcy of New Century Financial. As demand and prices continued to fall, the contagion spread to worldwide credit markets by August, and central banks began injecting liquidity. By July 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, companies which together owned or guaranteed half of the U.S. housing market, were on the verge of collapse; the Housing and Economic Recovery Act enabled the government to take over and cover their combined $1.6 trillion debt on September 7.\n In response to the growing crisis, governments around the world deployed massive bail-outs of financial institutions and other monetary and fiscal policies to prevent a collapse of the global financial system.[11] After the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the fourth largest U.S. investment bank, on September 15, the next day the Fed bailed out the American International Group (the largest U.S. insurance company), and on September 25 the government seized Washington Mutual (the largest savings and loan firm). On October 3, Congress passed the $800 billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which authorized the Treasury Department to purchase troubled assets and bank stocks. The Fed began a program of quantitative easing by buying treasury bonds and other assets, such as MBS, and the February 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, signed by newly elected President Barack Obama, included a range of measures intended to preserve existing jobs and create new ones. Combined, the initiatives, coupled with actions taken in other countries, ended the worst of the Great Recession by mid-2009.\n Assessments of the crisis's impact in the U.S. vary, but suggest that some 8.7 million jobs were lost, causing unemployment to rise from 5 percent in 2007 to a high of 10 percent in October 2009. The percentage of citizens living in poverty rose from 12.5 percent in 2007 to 15.1 percent in 2010. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 53 percent between October 2007 and March 2009, and some estimates suggest that one in four households lost 75 percent or more of their net worth. In 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was passed, overhauling financial regulations.[12] It was opposed by many Republicans, and it was weakened by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. The Basel III capital and liquidity standards were also adopted by countries around the world.[13][14] The recession was a significant factor in the European debt crisis of the 2010s.\n The crisis sparked the Great Recession, which, at the time, was the most severe global recession since the Great Depression.[16][17][18][19][20] It was also followed by the European debt crisis, which began with a deficit in Greece in late 2009, and the 2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis, which involved the bank failure of all three of the major banks in Iceland and, relative to the size of its economy, was the largest economic collapse suffered by any country in history.[21] It was among the five worst financial crises the world had experienced and led to a loss of more than $2 trillion from the global economy.[22][23] U.S. home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 (~$14.6 trillion in 2023) trillion.[24] The increase in cash out refinancings, as home values rose, fueled an increase in consumption that could no longer be sustained when home prices declined.[25][26][27] Many financial institutions owned investments whose value was based on home mortgages such as mortgage-backed securities, or credit derivatives used to insure them against failure, which declined in value significantly.[28][29][30] The International Monetary Fund estimated that large U.S. and European banks lost more than $1 trillion on toxic assets and from bad loans from January 2007 to September 2009.[31]\n Lack of investor confidence in bank solvency and declines in credit availability led to plummeting stock and commodity prices in late 2008 and early 2009.[32] The crisis rapidly spread into a global economic shock, resulting in several bank failures.[33] Economies worldwide slowed during this period since credit tightened and international trade declined.[34] Housing markets suffered and unemployment soared, resulting in evictions and foreclosures. Several businesses failed.[35][36] From its peak in the second quarter of 2007 at $61.4 trillion, household wealth in the United States fell $11 trillion, to $50.4 trillion by the end of the first quarter of 2009, resulting in a decline in consumption, then a decline in business investment.[37][38] In the fourth quarter of 2008, the quarter-over-quarter decline in real GDP in the U.S. was 8.4%.[39] The U.S. unemployment rate peaked at 11.0% in October 2009, the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre-crisis rate. The average hours per work week declined to 33, the lowest level since the government began collecting the data in 1964.[40][41]\n The economic crisis started in the U.S. but spread to the rest of the world.[35] U.S. consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007 and the rest of the world depended on the U.S. consumer as a source of demand.[citation needed][42][43] Toxic securities were owned by corporate and institutional investors globally. Derivatives such as credit default swaps also increased the linkage between large financial institutions. The de-leveraging of financial institutions, as assets were sold to pay back obligations that could not be refinanced in frozen credit markets, further accelerated the solvency crisis and caused a decrease in international trade. Reductions in the growth rates of developing countries were due to falls in trade, commodity prices, investment and remittances sent from migrant workers (example: Armenia[44]). States with fragile political systems feared that investors from Western states would withdraw their money because of the crisis.[45]\n As part of national fiscal policy response to the Great Recession, governments and central banks, including the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, provided then-unprecedented trillions of dollars in bailouts and stimulus, including expansive fiscal policy and monetary policy to offset the decline in consumption and lending capacity, avoid a further collapse, encourage lending, restore faith in the integral commercial paper markets, avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral, and provide banks with enough funds to allow customers to make withdrawals.[46] In effect, the central banks went from being the \"lender of last resort\" to the \"lender of only resort\" for a significant portion of the economy. In some cases the Fed was considered the \"buyer of last resort\".[47][48][49][50][51] During the fourth quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 (~$3.47 trillion in 2023) trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action in world history. Following a model initiated by the 2008 United Kingdom bank rescue package,[52][53] the governments of European nations and the United States guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems, ultimately purchasing $1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in major banks.[38] The Federal Reserve created then-significant amounts of new currency as a method to combat the liquidity trap.[54]\n Bailouts came in the form of trillions of dollars of loans, asset purchases, guarantees, and direct spending.[55] Significant controversy accompanied the bailouts, such as in the case of the AIG bonus payments controversy, leading to the development of a variety of \"decision making frameworks\", to help balance competing policy interests during times of financial crisis.[56] Alistair Darling, the U.K.'s Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time of the crisis, stated in 2018 that Britain came within hours of \"a breakdown of law and order\" the day that Royal Bank of Scotland was bailed-out.[57] Instead of financing more domestic loans, some banks instead spent some of the stimulus money in more profitable areas such as investing in emerging markets and foreign currencies.[58]\n In July 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was enacted in the United States to \"promote the financial stability of the United States\".[59] The Basel III capital and liquidity standards were adopted worldwide.[60] Since the 2008 financial crisis, consumer regulators in America have more closely supervised sellers of credit cards and home mortgages in order to deter anticompetitive practices that led to the crisis.[61]\n At least two major reports on the causes of the crisis were produced by the U.S. Congress: the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission report, released January 2011, and a report by the United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations entitled Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse, released April 2011.\n In total, 47 bankers served jail time as a result of the crisis, over half of which were from Iceland, where the crisis was the most severe and led to the collapse of all three major Icelandic banks.[62] In April 2012, Geir Haarde of Iceland became the only politician to be convicted as a result of the crisis.[63][64] Only one banker in the United States served jail time as a result of the crisis, Kareem Serageldin, a banker at Credit Suisse who was sentenced to 30 months in jail and returned $24.6 million in compensation for manipulating bond prices to hide $1 billion of losses.[65][62] No individuals in the United Kingdom were convicted as a result of the crisis.[66][67] Goldman Sachs paid $550 million to settle fraud charges after allegedly anticipating the crisis and selling toxic investments to its clients.[68]\n With fewer resources to risk in creative destruction, the number of patent applications was flat, compared to exponential increases in patent application in prior years.[69]\n Typical American families did not fare well, nor did the \"wealthy-but-not-wealthiest\" families just beneath the pyramid's top.[70][71][72] However, half of the poorest families in the United States did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis because they generally did not own financial investments whose value can fluctuate. The Federal Reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009, and found that the total wealth of 63% of all Americans declined in that period and 77% of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth, while only 50% of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease.[73][74][75]\n The following is a timeline of the major events of the financial crisis, including government responses, and the subsequent economic recovery.[76][77][78][79]\n There is a really good reason for tighter credit. Tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today. Businesses are facing the worst downturn since the Great Depression. This matters for credit decisions. A homeowner with equity in her home is very unlikely to default on a car loan or credit card debt. They will draw on this equity rather than lose their car and/or have a default placed on their credit record. On the other hand, a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk. In the case of businesses, their creditworthiness depends on their future profits. Profit prospects look much worse in November 2008 than they did in November 2007 ... While many banks are obviously at the brink, consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid. The problem with the economy is the loss of close to $6 trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth.[170] ... the pace of economic contraction is slowing. Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months. Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.[194] In the table, the names of emerging and developing economies are shown in boldface type, while the names of developed economies are in Roman (regular) type.\n The twenty largest economies contributing to global GDP (PPP) growth (2007–2017)[223]\n The expansion of central bank lending in response to the crisis was not only confined to the Federal Reserve's provision of aid to individual financial institutions. The Federal Reserve has also conducted a number of innovative lending programs with the goal of improving liquidity and strengthening different financial institutions and markets, such as Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. In this case, the major problem among the market is the lack of free cash reserves and flows to secure the loans. The Federal Reserve took a number of steps to deal with worries about liquidity in the financial markets. One of these steps was a credit line for major traders, who act as the Fed's partners in open market activities.[224] Also, loan programs were set up to make the money market mutual funds and commercial paper market more flexible. Also, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF) was put in place thanks to a joint effort with the US Department of the Treasury. This plan was meant to make it easier for consumers and businesses to get credit by giving Americans who owned high-quality asset-backed securities more credit.\n Before the crisis, the Federal Reserve's stocks of Treasury securities were sold to pay for the increase in credit. This method was meant to keep banks from trying to give out their extra savings, which could cause the federal funds rate to drop below where it was supposed to be.[225] However, in October 2008, the Federal Reserve was granted the power to provide banks with interest payments on their surplus reserves. This created a motivation for banks to retain their reserves instead of disbursing them, so reducing the need for the Federal Reserve to hedge its increased lending by decreases in alternative assets.[226]\n Money market funds also went through runs when people lost faith in the market. To keep it from getting worse, the Fed said it would give money to mutual fund companies. Also,  Department of Treasury said that it would briefly cover the assets of the fund. Both of these things helped get the fund market back to normal, which helped the commercial paper market, which most businesses use to run. The FDIC also did a number of things, like raise the insurance cap from $100,000 to $250,000, to boost customer trust.\n They engaged in Quantitative Easing, which added more than $4 trillion to the financial system and got banks to start lending again, both to each other and to people. Many homeowners who were trying to keep their homes from going into default got housing credits. A package of policies was passed that let borrowers refinance their loans even though the value of their homes was less than what they still owed on their mortgages.[227]\n While the causes of the bubble and subsequent crash are disputed, the precipitating factor for the Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 was the bursting of the United States housing bubble and the subsequent subprime mortgage crisis, which occurred due to a high default rate and resulting foreclosures of mortgage loans, particularly adjustable-rate mortgages. Some or all of the following factors contributed to the crisis:[228][82][83]\n The relaxing of credit lending standards by investment banks and commercial banks allowed for a significant increase in subprime lending. Subprime had not become less risky; Wall Street just accepted this higher risk.[267]\n Due to competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share, and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited, mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers. In the view of some analysts, the relatively conservative government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003. However, as market power shifted from securitizers to originators, and as intense competition from private securitizers undermined GSE power, mortgage standards declined and risky loans proliferated. The riskiest loans were originated in 2004–2007, the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs. The GSEs eventually relaxed their standards to try to catch up with the private banks.[268][269]\n A contrarian view is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac led the way to relaxed underwriting standards, starting in 1995, by advocating the use of easy-to-qualify automated underwriting and appraisal systems, by designing no-down-payment products issued by lenders, by the promotion of thousands of small mortgage brokers, and by their close relationship to subprime loan aggregators such as Countrywide.[270][271]\n Depending on how \"subprime\" mortgages are defined, they remained below 10% of all mortgage originations until 2004, when they rose to nearly 20% and remained there through the 2005–2006 peak of the United States housing bubble.[272]\n The majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, written by the six Democratic appointees, the minority report, written by three of the four Republican appointees, studies by Federal Reserve economists, and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis. Although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis, they contend that GSE loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks, and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios.\n In his dissent to the majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, conservative American Enterprise Institute fellow Peter J. Wallison[273] stated his belief that the roots of the financial crisis can be traced directly and primarily to affordable housing policies initiated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the 1990s and to massive risky loan purchases by government-sponsored entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Based upon information in the SEC's December 2011 securities fraud case against six former executives of Fannie and Freddie, Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto estimated that, in 2008, Fannie and Freddie held 13 million substandard loans totaling over $2 trillion.[274]\n In the early and mid-2000s, the Bush administration called numerous times for investigations into the safety and soundness of the GSEs and their swelling portfolio of subprime mortgages. On September 10, 2003, the United States House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing, at the urging of the administration, to assess safety and soundness issues and to review a recent report by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) that had uncovered accounting discrepancies within the two entities.[275][276] The hearings never resulted in new legislation or formal investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as many of the committee members refused to accept the report and instead rebuked OFHEO for their attempt at regulation.[277] Some, such as Wallison, believe this was an early warning to the systemic risk that the growing market in subprime mortgages posed to the U.S. financial system that went unheeded.[278]\n A 2000 United States Department of the Treasury study of lending trends for 305 cities from 1993 to 1998 showed that $467 billion of mortgage lending was made by Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)-covered lenders into low and mid-level income (LMI) borrowers and neighborhoods, representing 10% of all U.S. mortgage lending during the period. The majority of these were prime loans. Sub-prime loans made by CRA-covered institutions constituted a 3% market share of LMI loans in 1998,[279] but in the run-up to the crisis, fully 25% of all subprime lending occurred at CRA-covered institutions and another 25% of subprime loans had some connection with CRA.[280] However, most sub-prime loans were not made to the LMI borrowers targeted by the CRA,[citation needed][281][282] especially in the years 2005–2006 leading up to the crisis,[citation needed][283][282][284] nor did it find any evidence that lending under the CRA rules increased delinquency rates or that the CRA indirectly influenced independent mortgage lenders to ramp up sub-prime lending.[285][verification needed]\n To other analysts the delay between CRA rule changes in 1995 and the explosion of subprime lending is not surprising, and does not exonerate the CRA. They contend that there were two, connected causes to the crisis: the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra-low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. Both causes had to be in place before the crisis could take place.[286] Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive, totaling $4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007.[287] They also argue that the Federal Reserve's classification of CRA loans as \"prime\" is based on the faulty and self-serving assumption that high-interest-rate loans (3 percentage points over average) equal \"subprime\" loans.[288]\n Others have pointed out that there were not enough of these loans made to cause a crisis of this magnitude. In an article in Portfolio magazine, Michael Lewis spoke with one trader who noted that \"There weren't enough Americans with [bad] credit taking out [bad loans] to satisfy investors' appetite for the end product.\" Essentially, investment banks and hedge funds used financial innovation to enable large wagers to be made, far beyond the actual value of the underlying mortgage loans, using derivatives called credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations and synthetic CDOs.\n By March 2011, the FDIC had paid out $9 billion (c. $12 billion in 2023[289]) to cover losses on bad loans at 165 failed financial institutions.[290][291] The Congressional Budget Office estimated, in June 2011, that the bailout to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac exceeds $300 billion (c. $401 billion in 2023[289]) (calculated by adding the fair value deficits of the entities to the direct bailout funds at the time).[292]\n Economist Paul Krugman argued in January 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles and the global nature of the crisis undermines the case made by those who argue that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, CRA, or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis. In other words, bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes.[293]\n Countering Krugman, Wallison wrote: \"It is not true that every bubble—even a large bubble—has the potential to cause a financial crisis when it deflates.\" Wallison notes that other developed countries had \"large bubbles during the 1997–2007 period\" but \"the losses associated with mortgage delinquencies and defaults when these bubbles deflated were far lower than the losses suffered in the United States when the 1997–2007 [bubble] deflated.\" According to Wallison, the reason the U.S. residential housing bubble (as opposed to other types of bubbles) led to financial crisis was that it was supported by a huge number of substandard loans—generally with low or no downpayments.[294]\n Krugman's contention (that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that U.S. housing policy was not the cause of the crisis) is challenged by additional analysis. After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis, Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported (in December 2010): \"We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS [commercial mortgage-backed securities] loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis.\"[295] Other analysts support the contention that the crisis in commercial real estate and related lending took place after the crisis in residential real estate. Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo reported: \"The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006. Three years later, commercial real estate started feeling the effects.\"[verification needed][296] Denice A. Gierach, a real estate attorney and CPA, wrote:\n ... most of the commercial real estate loans were good loans destroyed by a really bad economy. In other words, the borrowers did not cause the loans to go bad-it was the economy.[297] Between 1998 and 2006, the price of the typical American house increased by 124%.[298] During the 1980s and 1990s, the national median home price ranged from 2.9 to 3.1 times median household income. By contrast, this ratio increased to 4.0 in 2004, and 4.6 in 2006.[299] This housing bubble resulted in many homeowners refinancing their homes at lower interest rates, or financing consumer spending by taking out second mortgages secured by the price appreciation.\n In a Peabody Award-winning program, NPR correspondents argued that a \"Giant Pool of Money\" (represented by $70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments) sought higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds early in the decade. This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with products such as the mortgage-backed security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies.[2]\n In effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the US, with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain, from the mortgage broker selling the loans to small banks that funded the brokers and the large investment banks behind them. By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted, and continued strong demand began to drive down lending standards.[2]\n The collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending, extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees. This essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority. Those securities first in line received investment-grade ratings from rating agencies. Securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested.[300]\n By September 2008, average U.S. housing prices had declined by over 20% from their mid-2006 peak.[301][302] As prices declined, borrowers with adjustable-rate mortgages could not refinance to avoid the higher payments associated with rising interest rates and began to default. During 2007, lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3 million properties, a 79% increase over 2006.[303] This increased to 2.3 million in 2008, an 81% increase vs. 2007.[304] By August 2008, approximately 9% of all U.S. mortgages outstanding were either delinquent or in foreclosure.[305] By September 2009, this had risen to 14.4%.[306][307]\n After the bubble burst, Australian economist John Quiggin wrote, \"And, unlike the Great Depression, this crisis was entirely the product of financial markets. There was nothing like the postwar turmoil of the 1920s, the struggles over gold convertibility and reparations, or the Smoot-Hawley tariff, all of which have shared the blame for the Great Depression.\" Instead, Quiggin lays the blame for the 2008 near-meltdown on financial markets, on political decisions to lightly regulate them, and on rating agencies which had self-interested incentives to give good ratings.[308]\n Lower interest rates encouraged borrowing. From 2000 to 2003, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5% to 1.0%.[309][310] This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot-com bubble and the September 11 attacks, as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation.[311] As early as 2002, it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the Fed \"needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble\".[312] Moreover, empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis.[313]\n Additional downward pressure on interest rates was created by rising U.S. current account deficit, which peaked along with the housing bubble in 2006. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke explained how trade deficits required the U.S. to borrow money from abroad, in the process bidding up bond prices and lowering interest rates.[314]\n Bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004, the U.S. current account deficit increased by $650 billion, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. Financing these deficits required the country to borrow large sums from abroad, much of it from countries running trade surpluses. These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The balance of payments identity requires that a country (such as the US) running a current account deficit also have a capital account (investment) surplus of the same amount. Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds (capital) flowed into the U.S. to finance its imports.\n All of this created demand for various types of financial assets, raising the prices of those assets while lowering interest rates. Foreign investors had these funds to lend either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China) or because of high oil prices. Ben Bernanke referred to this as a \"saving glut\".[315]\n A flood of funds (capital or liquidity) reached the U.S. financial markets. Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing Treasury bonds and thus avoided much of the direct effect of the crisis. U.S. households, used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets. Financial institutions invested foreign funds in mortgage-backed securities.[citation needed]\n The Fed then raised the Fed funds rate significantly between July 2004 and July 2006.[316] This contributed to an increase in one-year and five-year adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates, making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners.[317] This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble, as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates, and it became riskier to speculate in housing.[318][319] U.S. housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst.[320][38]\n Subprime lending standards declined in the U.S.: in early 2000, a subprime borrower had a FICO score of 660 or less. By 2005, many lenders dropped the required FICO score to 620, making it much easier to qualify for prime loans and making subprime lending a riskier business. Proof of income and assets were de-emphasized. Loans at first required full documentation, then low documentation, then no documentation. One subprime mortgage product that gained wide acceptance was the no income, no job, no asset verification required (NINJA) mortgage. Informally, these loans were aptly referred to as \"liar loans\" because they encouraged borrowers to be less than honest in the loan application process.[321] Testimony given to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission by whistleblower Richard M. Bowen III, on events during his tenure as the Business Chief Underwriter for Correspondent Lending in the Consumer Lending Group for Citigroup, where he was responsible for over 220 professional underwriters, suggests that by 2006 and 2007, the collapse of mortgage underwriting standards was endemic. His testimony stated that by 2006, 60% of mortgages purchased by Citigroup from some 1,600 mortgage companies were \"defective\" (were not underwritten to policy, or did not contain all policy-required documents)—this, despite the fact that each of these 1,600 originators was contractually responsible (certified via representations and warrantees) that its mortgage originations met Citigroup standards. Moreover, during 2007, \"defective mortgages (from mortgage originators contractually bound to perform underwriting to Citi's standards) increased ... to over 80% of production\".[322]\n In separate testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, officers of Clayton Holdings, the largest residential loan due diligence and securitization surveillance company in the United States and Europe, testified that Clayton's review of over 900,000 mortgages issued from January 2006 to June 2007 revealed that scarcely 54% of the loans met their originators' underwriting standards. The analysis (conducted on behalf of 23 investment and commercial banks, including 7 \"too big to fail\" banks) additionally showed that 28% of the sampled loans did not meet the minimal standards of any issuer. Clayton's analysis further showed that 39% of these loans (i.e. those not meeting any issuer's minimal underwriting standards) were subsequently securitized and sold to investors.[323][324]\n Predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders, enticing borrowers to enter into \"unsafe\" or \"unsound\" secured loans for inappropriate purposes.[325][326][327]\n In June 2008, Countrywide Financial was sued by then California Attorney General Jerry Brown for \"unfair business practices\" and \"false advertising\", alleging that Countrywide used \"deceptive tactics to push homeowners into complicated, risky, and expensive loans so that the company could sell as many loans as possible to third-party investors\".[328] In May 2009, Bank of America modified 64,000 Countrywide loans as a result.[329] When housing prices decreased, homeowners in ARMs then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments, since their home equity had disappeared. This caused Countrywide's financial condition to deteriorate, ultimately resulting in a decision by the Office of Thrift Supervision to seize the lender. One Countrywide employee—who would later plead guilty to two counts of wire fraud and spent 18 months in prison—stated that, \"If you had a pulse, we gave you a loan.\"[330]\n Former employees from Ameriquest, which was United States' leading wholesale lender, described a system in which they were pushed to falsify mortgage documents and then sell the mortgages to Wall Street banks eager to make fast profits. There is growing evidence that such mortgage frauds may be a cause of the crisis.[331]\n According to Barry Eichengreen, the roots of the financial crisis lay in the deregulation of financial markets.[332] A 2012 OECD study[333] suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced the financial crisis. In other cases, laws were changed or enforcement weakened in parts of the financial system. Key examples include:\n A 2011 paper suggested that Canada's avoidance of a banking crisis in 2008 (as well as in prior eras) could be attributed to Canada possessing a single, powerful, overarching regulator, while the United States had a weak, crisis prone and fragmented banking system with multiple competing regulatory bodies.[351]\n Prior to the crisis, financial institutions became highly leveraged, increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses. Much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off-balance sheet securitization and derivatives, which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels.[352][verification needed]\n U.S. households and financial institutions became increasingly indebted or overleveraged during the years preceding the crisis.[353] This increased their vulnerability to the collapse of the housing bubble and worsened the ensuing economic downturn.[354] Key statistics include:\n Free cash used by consumers from home equity extraction doubled from $627 billion in 2001 to $1,428 billion in 2005 as the housing bubble built, a total of nearly $5 trillion over the period, contributing to economic growth worldwide.[25][26][27] U.S. home mortgage debt relative to GDP increased from an average of 46% during the 1990s to 73% during 2008, reaching $10.5 trillion (c. $14.6 trillion in 2023[289]).[24]\n U.S. household debt as a percentage of annual disposable personal income was 127% at the end of 2007, versus 77% in 1990.[353] In 1981, U.S. private debt was 123% of GDP; by the third quarter of 2008, it was 290%.[355]\n From 2004 to 2007, the top five U.S. investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage, which increased their vulnerability to a financial shock. Changes in capital requirements, intended to keep U.S. banks competitive with their European counterparts, allowed lower risk weightings for AAA-rated securities. The shift from first-loss tranches to AAA-rated tranches was seen by regulators as a risk reduction that compensated the higher leverage.[356] These five institutions reported over $4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007, about 30% of U.S. nominal GDP for 2007. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated, Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire-sale prices, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks, subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation. With the exception of Lehman, these companies required or received government support.[357]\n Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, owned or guaranteed nearly $5 trillion (c. $6.95 trillion in 2023[289]) trillion in mortgage obligations at the time they were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government in September 2008.[358][359]\n These seven entities were highly leveraged and had $9 trillion in debt or guarantee obligations; yet they were not subject to the same regulation as depository banks.[342][360]\n Behavior that may be optimal for an individual, such as saving more during adverse economic conditions, can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior, as ultimately one person's consumption is another person's income. Too many consumers attempting to save or pay down debt simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist Hyman Minsky also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.[354]\n In April 2009, Federal Reserve vice-chair Janet Yellen discussed these paradoxes:\n Once this massive credit crunch hit, it didn't take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse feedback loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms—and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state—nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.[354] The term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives, such as offsetting a particular risk exposure (such as the default of a borrower) or to assist with obtaining financing. Examples pertinent to this crisis included: the adjustable-rate mortgage; the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or collateralized debt obligations (CDO) for sale to investors, a type of securitization; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps (CDS). The usage of these products expanded dramatically in the years leading up to the crisis. These products vary in complexity and the ease with which they can be valued on the books of financial institutions.[citation needed]\n CDO issuance grew from an estimated $20 billion in Q1 2004 to its peak of over $180 billion by Q1 2007, then declined back under $20 billion by Q1 2008. Further, the credit quality of CDO's declined from 2000 to 2007, as the level of subprime and other non-prime mortgage debt increased from 5% to 36% of CDO assets. As described in the section on subprime lending, the CDS and portfolio of CDS called synthetic CDO enabled a theoretically infinite amount to be wagered on the finite value of housing loans outstanding, provided that buyers and sellers of the derivatives could be found. For example, buying a CDS to insure a CDO ended up giving the seller the same risk as if they owned the CDO, when those CDO's became worthless.[361]\n This boom in innovative financial products went hand in hand with more complexity. It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage (including mortgage brokers, specialized originators, the securitizers and their due diligence firms, managing agents and trading desks, and finally investors, insurances and providers of repo funding). With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information (including FICO scores on creditworthiness, appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations, and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks). Instead of spreading risk this provided the ground for fraudulent acts, misjudgments and finally market collapse.[362] Economists have studied the crisis as an instance of cascades in financial networks, where institutions' instability destabilized other institutions and led to knock-on effects.[363][364]\n Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator at the Financial Times, wrote in June 2009 that certain financial innovations enabled firms to circumvent regulations, such as off-balance sheet financing that affects the leverage or capital cushion reported by major banks, stating: \"an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade—the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself—was to find a way round regulation.\"[365]\n Mortgage risks were underestimated by almost all institutions in the chain from originator to investor by underweighting the possibility of falling housing prices based on historical trends of the past 50 years. Limitations of default and prepayment models, the heart of pricing models, led to overvaluation of mortgage and asset-backed products and their derivatives by originators, securitizers, broker-dealers, rating-agencies, insurance underwriters and the vast majority of investors (with the exception of certain hedge funds).[366][367] While financial derivatives and structured products helped partition and shift risk between financial participants, it was the underestimation of falling housing prices and the resultant losses that led to aggregate risk.[367]\n For a variety of reasons, market participants did not accurately measure the risk inherent with financial innovation such as MBS and CDOs or understand its effect on the overall stability of the financial system.[255] The pricing model for CDOs clearly did not reflect the level of risk they introduced into the system. Banks estimated that $450 billion of CDO were sold between \"late 2005 to the middle of 2007\"; among the $102 billion of those that had been liquidated, JPMorgan estimated that the average recovery rate for \"high quality\" CDOs was approximately 32 cents on the dollar, while the recovery rate for mezzanine capital CDO was approximately five cents for every dollar.\n AIG insured obligations of various financial institutions through the usage of credit default swaps. The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted. However, AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008. U.S. taxpayers provided over $180 billion in government loans and investments in AIG during 2008 and early 2009, through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions, including many large global financial institutions.[368][unreliable source?][369]\n The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) made the major government study of the crisis. It concluded in January 2011:\n The Commission concludes AIG failed and was rescued by the government primarily because its enormous sales of credit default swaps were made without putting up the initial collateral, setting aside capital reserves, or hedging its exposure—a profound failure in corporate governance, particularly its risk management practices. AIG's failure was possible because of the sweeping deregulation of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, including credit default swaps, which effectively eliminated federal and state regulation of these products, including capital and margin requirements that would have lessened the likelihood of AIG's failure.[370][371][372] The limitations of a widely used financial model also were not properly understood.[373][374] This formula assumed that the price of CDS was correlated with and could predict the correct price of mortgage-backed securities. Because it was highly tractable, it rapidly came to be used by a huge percentage of CDO and CDS investors, issuers, and rating agencies.[374] According to one Wired article:\n Then the model fell apart. Cracks started appearing early on, when financial markets began behaving in ways that users of Li's formula hadn't expected. The cracks became full-fledged canyons in 2008—when ruptures in the financial system's foundation swallowed up trillions of dollars and put the survival of the global banking system in serious peril ... Li's Gaussian copula formula will go down in history as instrumental in causing the unfathomable losses that brought the world financial system to its knees.[374]  As financial assets became more complex and harder to value, investors were reassured by the fact that the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators accepted as valid some complex mathematical models that showed the risks were much smaller than they actually were.[375] George Soros commented that \"The super-boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves. Similarly, the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products. It was a shocking abdication of responsibility.\"[376]\n A conflict of interest between investment management professional and institutional investors, combined with a global glut in investment capital, led to bad investments by asset managers in over-priced credit assets. Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management. There is, therefore, an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation. As the glut in global investment capital caused the yields on credit assets to decline, asset managers were faced with the choice of either investing in assets where returns did not reflect true credit risk or returning funds to clients. Many asset managers continued to invest client funds in over-priced (under-yielding) investments, to the detriment of their clients, so they could maintain their assets under management. They supported this choice with a \"plausible deniability\" of the risks associated with subprime-based credit assets because the loss experience with early \"vintages\" of subprime loans was so low.[377]\n Despite the dominance of the above formula, there are documented attempts of the financial industry, occurring before the crisis, to address the formula limitations, specifically the lack of dependence dynamics and the poor representation of extreme events.[378] The volume Credit Correlation: Life After Copulas, published in 2007 by World Scientific, summarizes a 2006 conference held by Merrill Lynch in London where several practitioners attempted to propose models rectifying some of the copula limitations. See also the article by Donnelly and Embrechts[379] and the book by Brigo, Pallavicini and Torresetti, that reports relevant warnings and research on CDOs appeared in 2006.[380]\n There is strong evidence that the riskiest, worst performing mortgages were funded through the \"shadow banking system\" and that competition from the shadow banking system may have pressured more traditional institutions to lower their underwriting standards and originate riskier loans.\n In a June 2008 speech, President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Timothy Geithner—who in 2009 became United States Secretary of the Treasury—placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a run on the entities in the \"parallel\" banking system, also called the shadow banking system. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls. Further, these entities were vulnerable because of asset–liability mismatch, meaning that they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would force them to engage in rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities:\n In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2 trillion. Assets financed overnight in tri-party repo grew to $2.5 trillion. Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8 trillion. The combined balance sheets of the five largest investment banks totaled $4 trillion. In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over $6 trillion, and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10 trillion. The combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles.[381] Economist Paul Krugman, laureate of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, described the run on the shadow banking system as the \"core of what happened\" to cause the crisis. He referred to this lack of controls as \"malign neglect\" and argued that regulation should have been imposed on all banking-like activity.[342] Without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of mortgage-backed securities or asset-backed commercial paper, investment banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations.[381][342]\n This meant that nearly one-third of the U.S. lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into June 2009.[382] According to the Brookings Institution, at that time the traditional banking system did not have the capital to close this gap: \"It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume.\" The authors also indicate that some forms of securitization were \"likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions\". While traditional banks raised their lending standards, it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that was the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing.[35]\n In a 2008 paper, Ricardo J. Caballero, Emmanuel Farhi, and Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas argued that the financial crisis was attributable to \"global asset scarcity, which led to large capital flows toward the United States and to the creation of asset bubbles that eventually burst\".[383] Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas argued \"that the sharp rise in oil prices following the subprime crisis – nearly 100 percent in just a matter of months and on the face of recessionary shocks – was the result of a speculative response to the financial crisis itself, in an attempt to rebuild asset supply. That is, the global economy was subject to one shock with multiple implications rather than to two separate shocks (financial and oil).\"[383]\n Long-only commodity index funds became popular – by one estimate investment increased from $90 billion in 2006 to $200 billion at the end of 2007, while commodity prices increased 71% – which raised concern as to whether these index funds caused the commodity bubble. The empirical research has been mixed.[384]\n The cause of the global asset bubble can be partially attributable to the global savings glut. As theorized by Andrew Metrick, the demand for safe assets following the Asian Financial Crisis coupled with the lack of circulating treasuries created an unmet demand for \"risk free\" assets. Thus, institutional investors like sovereign wealth funds and pension funds began purchasing synthetic safe assets like Triple-A Mortgage Backed Securities.[385]\n As a consequence, the demand for so-called safe assets fueled the free flow of capital into housing in the United States. This greatly worsened the crisis as banks and other financial institutions were incentivized to issue more mortgages than before.\n In a 1998 book, John McMurtry suggested that a financial crisis is a systemic crisis of capitalism itself.[386]\n In his 1978 book, The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism, Ravi Batra suggests that growing inequality of financial capitalism produces speculative bubbles that burst and result in depression and major political changes. He also suggested that a \"demand gap\" related to differing wage and productivity growth explains deficit and debt dynamics important to stock market developments.[387]\n John Bellamy Foster, a political economy analyst and editor of the Monthly Review, believed that the decrease in GDP growth rates since the early 1970s is due to increasing market saturation.[388]\n Marxian economics followers Andrew Kliman, Michael Roberts, and Guglielmo Carchedi, in contradistinction to the Monthly Review school represented by Foster, pointed to capitalism's long-term tendency of the rate of profit to fall as the underlying cause of crises generally. From this point of view, the problem was the inability of capital to grow or accumulate at sufficient rates through productive investment alone. Low rates of profit in productive sectors led to speculative investment in riskier assets, where there was potential for greater return on investment. The speculative frenzy of the late 1990s and 2000s was, in this view, a consequence of a rising organic composition of capital, expressed through the fall in the rate of profit. According to Michael Roberts, the fall in the rate of profit \"eventually triggered the credit crunch of 2007 when credit could no longer support profits\".[389]\n In 2005 book, The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism, John C. Bogle wrote that \"Corporate America went astray largely because the power of managers went virtually unchecked by our gatekeepers for far too long\". Echoing the central thesis of James Burnham's 1941 seminal book, The Managerial Revolution, Bogle cites issues, including:[390]\n In his book The Big Mo, Mark Roeder, a former executive at the Swiss-based UBS Bank, suggested that large-scale momentum, or The Big Mo, \"played a pivotal role\" in the financial crisis. Roeder suggested that \"recent technological advances, such as computer-driven trading programs, together with the increasingly interconnected nature of markets, has magnified the momentum effect. This has made the financial sector inherently unstable.\"[391]\n Robert Reich attributed the economic downturn to the stagnation of wages in the United States, particularly those of the hourly workers who comprise 80% of the workforce. This stagnation forced the population to borrow to meet the cost of living.[392]\n Economists Ailsa McKay and Margunn Bjørnholt argued that the financial crisis and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession.[393]\n A report by the International Labour Organization concluded that cooperative banking institutions were less likely to fail than their competitors during the crisis. The cooperative banking sector had 20% market share of the European banking sector, but accounted for only 7% of all the write-downs and losses between the third quarter of 2007 and first quarter of 2011.[394] In 2008, in the U.S., the rate of commercial bank failures was almost triple that of credit unions, and almost five times the credit union rate in 2010.[395] Credit unions increased their lending to small- and medium-sized businesses while overall lending to those businesses decreased.[396]\n Economists, particularly followers of mainstream economics, mostly failed to predict the crisis.[397] The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania's online business journal examined why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis and concluded that economists used mathematical models that failed to account for the critical roles that banks and other financial institutions, as opposed to producers and consumers of goods and services, play in the economy.[398]\n Several followers of heterodox economics predicted the crisis, with varying arguments. Dirk Bezemer[399] credits 12 economists with predicting the crisis: Dean Baker (US), Wynne Godley (UK), Fred Harrison (UK), Michael Hudson (US), Eric Janszen (US), Steve Keen (Australia), Jakob Broechner Madsen & Jens Kjaer Sørensen (Denmark), Med Jones (US)[400] Kurt Richebächer (US), Nouriel Roubini (US), Peter Schiff (US), and Robert Shiller (US).\n Shiller, a founder of the Case–Shiller index that measures home prices, wrote an article a year before the collapse of Lehman Brothers in which he predicted that a slowing U.S. housing market would cause the housing bubble to burst, leading to financial collapse.[401] Peter Schiff regularly appeared on television in the years before the crisis and warned of the impending real estate collapse.[402]\n The Austrian School regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit-fueled bubble caused by laxity in monetary supply.[403]\n There were other economists that did warn of a pending crisis.[404]\n The former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. In 2005, at a celebration honoring Alan Greenspan, who was about to retire as chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector.[405] In that paper, Rajan \"argued that disaster might loom\".[406] Rajan argued that financial sector managers were encouraged to \"take risks that generate severe adverse consequences with small probability but, in return, offer generous compensation the rest of the time. These risks are known as tail risks. But perhaps the most important concern is whether banks will be able to provide liquidity to financial markets so that if the tail risk does materialize, financial positions can be unwound and losses allocated so that the consequences to the real economy are minimized.\"\n Stock trader and financial risk engineer Nassim Nicholas Taleb, author of the 2007 book The Black Swan, spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of and reliance on bad risk models and reliance on forecasting, and framed the problem as part of \"robustness and fragility\".[407][408] He also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis (\"They didn't listen, so I took their money\").[409] According to David Brooks from The New York Times, \"Taleb not only has an explanation for what's happening, he saw it coming.\"[410]\n Popular articles published in the mass media have led the general public to believe that the majority of economists have failed in their obligation to predict the financial crisis. For example, an article in The New York Times noted that economist Nouriel Roubini warned of such crisis as early as September 2006, and stated that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions.[411] According to The Guardian, Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession, while The New York Times labelled him \"Dr. Doom\".[412]\n In a 2012 article in the journal Japan and the World Economy, Andrew K. Rose and Mark M. Spiegel used a Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC) model on a cross-section of 107 countries to evaluate potential causes of the 2008 crisis. The authors examined various economic indicators, ignoring contagion effects across countries. The authors concluded: \"We include over sixty potential causes of the crisis, covering such categories as: financial system policies and conditions; asset price appreciation in real estate and equity markets; international imbalances and foreign reserve adequacy; macroeconomic policies; and institutional and geographic features. Despite the fact that we use a wide number of possible causes in a flexible statistical framework, we are unable to link most of the commonly cited causes of the crisis to its incidence across countries. This negative finding in the cross-section makes us skeptical of the accuracy of 'early warning' systems of potential crises, which must also predict their timing.\"[413]\n The first visible institution to run into trouble in the United States was the Southern California–based IndyMac, a spin-off of Countrywide Financial. Before its failure, IndyMac Bank was the largest savings and loan association in the Los Angeles market and the seventh largest mortgage loan originator in the United States.[414] The failure of IndyMac Bank on July 11, 2008, was the fourth largest bank failure in United States history up until the crisis precipitated even larger failures,[415] and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift.[416] IndyMac Bank's parent corporation was IndyMac Bancorp until the FDIC seized IndyMac Bank.[417] IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in July 2008.[417]\n IndyMac Bank was founded as Countrywide Mortgage Investment in 1985 by David S. Loeb and Angelo Mozilo[418][419] as a means of collateralizing Countrywide Financial loans too big to be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. In 1997, Countrywide spun off IndyMac as an independent company run by Mike Perry, who remained its CEO until the downfall of the bank in July 2008.[420]\n The primary causes of its failure were largely associated with its business strategy of originating and securitizing Alt-A loans on a large scale. This strategy resulted in rapid growth and a high concentration of risky assets. From its inception as a savings association in 2000, IndyMac grew to the seventh largest savings and loan and ninth largest originator of mortgage loans in the United States. During 2006, IndyMac originated over $90 billion (~$131 billion in 2023) of mortgages.\n IndyMac's aggressive growth strategy, use of Alt-A and other nontraditional loan products, insufficient underwriting, credit concentrations in residential real estate in the California and Florida markets—states, alongside Nevada and Arizona, where the housing bubble was most pronounced—and heavy reliance on costly funds borrowed from a Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and from brokered deposits, led to its demise when the mortgage market declined in 2007.\n IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower's income or assets, and to borrowers with poor credit histories. Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well. As an Alt-A lender, IndyMac's business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower's needs, using an extensive array of risky option-adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARMs), subprime loans, 80/20 loans, and other nontraditional products. Ultimately, loans were made to many borrowers who simply could not afford to make their payments. The thrift remained profitable only as long as it was able to sell those loans in the secondary mortgage market. IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria: see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne, Chief Risk Officer, to the regulating agencies.[421][422][423]\n On May 12, 2008, in the \"Capital\" section of its last 10-Q, IndyMac revealed that it may not be well capitalized in the future.[424]\n IndyMac reported that during April 2008, Moody's and Standard & Poor's downgraded the ratings on a significant number of Mortgage-backed security (MBS) bonds—including $160 million (~$222 million in 2023) issued by IndyMac that the bank retained in its MBS portfolio. IndyMac concluded that these downgrades would have harmed its risk-based capital ratio as of June 30, 2008. Had these lowered ratings been in effect on March 31, 2008, IndyMac concluded that the bank's capital ratio would have been 9.27% total risk-based. IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below \"well capitalized\" (minimum 10% risk-based capital ratio) to \"adequately capitalized\" (8–10% risk-based capital ratio) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds.\n Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) later pointed out that brokered deposits made up more than 37% of IndyMac's total deposits, and ask the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits.[425] With $18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31,[424] Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $7 billion in brokered deposits. While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly, a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at $500 million a month, had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30.\n IndyMac was taking new measures to preserve capital, such as deferring interest payments on some preferred securities. Dividends on common shares had already been suspended for the first quarter of 2008, after being cut in half the previous quarter. The company still had not secured a significant capital infusion nor found a ready buyer.[426]\n IndyMac reported that the bank's risk-based capital was only $47 million above the minimum required for this 10% mark. But it did not reveal some of that $47 million (~$65.3 million in 2023) capital it claimed it had, as of March 31, 2008, was fabricated.[427]\n When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed, IndyMac was forced to hold $10.7 billion (~$15.2 billion in 2023) of loans it could not sell in the secondary market. Its reduced liquidity was further exacerbated in late June 2008 when account holders withdrew $1.55 billion (~$2.15 billion in 2023) or about 7.5% of IndyMac's deposits.[424] This bank run on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS. The letter outlined the Senator's concerns with IndyMac. While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac's demise, the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound way it was operated.[421]\n On June 26, 2008, Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY), a member of the Senate Banking Committee, chairman of Congress' Joint Economic Committee and the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, released several letters he had sent to regulators, in which he was\"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers.\" Some worried depositors began to withdraw money.[428][429]\n On July 7, 2008, IndyMac announced on the company blog that it:\n IndyMac announced the closure of both its retail lending and wholesale divisions, halted new loan submissions, and cut 3,800 jobs.[430]\n On July 11, 2008, citing liquidity concerns, the FDIC put IndyMac Bank into conservatorship. A bridge bank, IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB, was established to assume control of IndyMac Bank's assets, its secured liabilities, and its insured deposit accounts. The FDIC announced plans to open IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB on July 14, 2008. Until then, depositors would have access to their insured deposits through ATMs, their existing checks, and their existing debit cards. Telephone and Internet account access was restored when the bank reopened.[127][431][432] The FDIC guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to US$100,000, and declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount, guaranteeing 50% of any amounts in excess of $100,000.[416] Yet, even with the pending sale of Indymac to IMB Management Holdings, an estimated 10,000 uninsured depositors of Indymac are still at a loss of over $270 million.[433][434]\n With $32 billion in assets, IndyMac Bank was one of the largest bank failures in American history.[435]\n IndyMac Bancorp filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 31, 2008.[417]\n Initially the companies affected were those directly involved in home construction and mortgage lending such as Northern Rock and Countrywide Financial, as they could no longer obtain financing through the credit markets. Over 100 mortgage lenders went bankrupt during 2007 and 2008. Concerns that investment bank Bear Stearns would collapse in March 2008 resulted in its fire-sale to JP Morgan Chase. The financial institution crisis hit its peak in September and October 2008. Several major institutions either failed, were acquired under duress, or were subject to government takeover. These included Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Citigroup, and AIG.[38] On October 6, 2008, three weeks after Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, Lehman's former CEO Richard S. Fuld Jr. found himself before Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who chaired the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Fuld said he was a victim of the collapse, blaming a \"crisis of confidence\" in the markets for dooming his firm.[436]\n The initial articles and some subsequent material were adapted from the Wikinfo article Financial crisis of 2007–2008 released under the GNU Free Documentation License Version 1.2\n Reports on causes\n Journalism and interviews\n",

        "title": "COVID-19 recession",
        "content": "\n The COVID-19 recession was a global economic recession caused by COVID-19 lockdowns. The recession began in most countries in February 2020. After a year of global economic slowdown that saw stagnation of economic growth and consumer activity, the COVID-19 lockdowns and other precautions taken in early 2020 drove the global economy into crisis.[1][2][3][4] Within seven months, every advanced economy had fallen to recession.[5][6]\n The first major sign of recession was the 2020 stock market crash, which saw major indices drop 20 to 30% in late February and March. Recovery began in early April 2020; by April 2022, the GDP for most major economies had either returned to or exceeded pre-pandemic levels[7] and many market indices recovered or even set new records by late 2020.[8][9][10]\n The recession saw unusually high and rapid increases in unemployment in many countries. By October 2020, more than 10 million unemployment cases had been filed in the United States,[11] swamping state-funded unemployment insurance computer systems and processes.[12][13] The United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment would wipe out 6.7% of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020—equivalent to 195 million full-time workers.[14] In some countries, unemployment was expected to be around 10%, with more severely affected nations from the pandemic having higher unemployment rates.[15][16][17] Developing countries were also affected by a drop in remittances[18] and exacerbating COVID-19 pandemic-related famines.[19]\n The recession and the accompanying 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war led to a drop in oil prices; the collapse of tourism, the hospitality industry, and the energy industry; and a downturn in consumer activity in comparison to the previous decade.[20][21][22] The 2021–2023 global energy crisis was driven by a global surge in demand as the world exited the early recession caused by pandemic-related lockdown measures, particularly due to strong energy demand in Asia.[23][24][25]\nThis was then further exacerbated by the reaction to escalations of the Russo-Ukrainian War, culminating in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the 2022 Russian debt default.[26]\n Since the financial crisis of 2007–2008, there has been a large increase in corporate debt, rising from 84% of gross world product in 2009 to 92% in 2019, or about $72 trillion.[27][28] In the world's eight largest economies—China, United States, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy, and Germany—total corporate debt was about $51 trillion in 2019, compared to $34 trillion in 2009.[29] If the economic climate worsens, companies with high levels of debt run the risk of being unable to make their interest payments to lenders or refinance their debt, forcing them into restructuring.[30] The Institute of International Finance forecast in 2019 that, in an economic downturn half as severe as the 2008 crisis, $19 trillion in debt would be owed by non-financial firms without the earnings to cover the interest payments on the debt they issued.[29] The McKinsey Global Institute warned in 2018 that the greatest risks would be to emerging markets such as China, India, and Brazil, where 25–30% of bonds have been issued by high-risk companies.[31]\n During 2019, the IMF reported that the world economy was going through a \"synchronized slowdown\", which entered into its slowest pace since the Global Financial Crisis.[32] 'Cracks' were showing in the consumer market as global markets began to suffer through a 'sharp deterioration' of manufacturing activity.[33] Global growth was believed to have peaked in 2017, when the world's total industrial output began to start a sustained decline in early 2018.[34] The IMF blamed 'heightened trade and geopolitical tensions' as the main reason for the slowdown, citing Brexit and the China–United States trade war as primary reasons for slowdown in 2019, while other economists blamed liquidity issues.[32][35]\n In April 2019, the U.S. yield curve inverted, which sparked fears of a 2020 recession across the world. The inverted yield curve and China–U.S. trade war fears prompted a sell-off in global stock markets during March 2019, which prompted more fears that a recession was imminent.[36] Rising debt levels in the European Union and the United States had always been a concern for economists. However, in 2019, that concern was heightened during the economic slowdown, and economists began warning of a 'debt bomb' occurring during the next financial crisis. Debt in 2019 was 50% higher than that during the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[37] Economists[who?] have argued that this increased debt is what led to debt defaults in economies and businesses across the world during the recession.[38][39] The first signs of trouble leading up to the collapse occurred in September 2019, when the US Federal Reserve began intervening in the role of investor to provide funds in the repo markets; the overnight repo rate spiked above an unprecedented 6% during that time, which would play a crucial factor in triggering the events that led up to the crash.[40][failed verification]\n From 2018 to early 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump set tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. described as \"unfair trade practices\".[41] Among those trade practices and their effects had been the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property, and the forced transfer of American technology to China.[42]\n Trump's tariffs caused significant damage to the economy of countries around the world.[43] In the United States, it brought struggles for farmers and manufacturers and higher prices for consumers, which resulted in the U.S. manufacturing industry entering into a \"mild recession\" during 2019.[44] In other countries it also caused economic damage, including violent protests in Chile and Ecuador due to transport and energy price surges, though some countries had benefited from increased manufacturing to fill the gaps. It also led to stock market instability. Governments around the world took steps to address some of the damage caused by the tariffs.[45][46][47][48] During the recession, the downturn of consumerism and manufacturing from the trade war is believed to have worsened the economic crisis.[49][50]\n In Europe, economies were hampered due to uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, better known as Brexit. British and EU growth stagnated during 2019 leading up to Brexit, mainly due to uncertainty in the UK caused by political figures and movements aiming to oppose, reverse or otherwise impede the 2016 Brexit Referendum, resulting in delays and extensions.[51][failed verification] Many businesses left the United Kingdom to move into the EU, which resulted in trade loss and economic downturn for both EU members and the UK.[52][53][54][51]\n In August 2021, it was reported that China's second-largest property developer, Evergrande Group, was entrenched in $300 billion (~$333 billion in 2023) of debt.[55] As the company missed several payment deadlines in September 2021,[56] it seemed likely the company would fail without government intervention, as stocks within the company having already plummeted by 85%. Since China is the second largest economy in the world and property makes up a large amount of their GDP, it threatens to destabilise the COVID-19 recession even further, especially considering China is currently deep within a housing bubble eclipsing the United States housing bubble that led to the previous global recession.\n The 2021–2023 global energy shortage is the most recent in a series of cyclical energy shortages experienced over the last fifty years. The Russian military buildup outside Ukraine and subsequent invasion have also threatened the energy supply from Russia to Europe, while increasing the cost of oil causing European countries to diversify their source of energy import.\nThe economic fallout from the 2021–2023 global energy crisis and the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has had an impact on oil prices worldwide,[57] most notably the unprecedented measures taken on the SWIFT System and Tit-for-Tat Responses to comprehensive sanctions from other countries.[58] Preceding an official announcement regarding import bans on 8 March 2022, there were reports of proposed bans regarding Russian oil and gas imports by the US and the EU.[59]\n This was in addition to the already existing actions taken by American companies on multiple Russian entities with ties to the Russian government, with Russia's trading status also being called into question on security grounds. Prior to the ban having been implemented, the value of the Russian ruble had dropped by record levels as the price of oil hit a 14-year high.[60] The talks about whether or not to implement an International Energy Embargo were already reported to have been impacting the Russian oil market due to pre-existing fears by investors[61] by 10 March, there were reports stating that Russia's debt rating was downgraded by Fitch from \"B\" to \"C\", indicating a potential default was imminent. This ultimately came to pass after 27 June with the 2022 Russian debt default.[62][63]\n The COVID-19 pandemic is the most disruptive pandemic since the Spanish flu in 1918.[64] When the pandemic first arose in late 2019 and more consequently in 2020, the world was going through economic stagnation and significant consumer downturn. Most economists believed a recession, though one which would not be particularly severe, was coming. As a result of the rapid spread of the pandemic, economies across the world initiated population lockdowns to curb the spread of the pandemic. This resulted in the collapse of various industries and consumerism all at once, which put major pressure on banks and employment.[65][66][67] This caused a stock market crash and, thereafter, the recession. With new social distancing measures taken in response to the pandemic, lockdowns occurred across much of the world economy.[9]\n The COVID-19 pandemic was a pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); the outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern from 30 January 2020 to 5 May 2023, and recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020.[68][69] The response to the pandemic has led to severe global economic disruption,[70] the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events,[71] and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic buying.[72][73] Schools, universities and colleges have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 63 countries, affecting approximately 47 percent of the world's student population. Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.[74] However, the virus is already spreading within communities in large parts of the world, with many not knowing where or how they were infected.[75]\n The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences beyond the spread of the disease and efforts to quarantine it. As the pandemic has spread around the globe, concerns have shifted from supply-side manufacturing issues to decreased business in the services sector.[76] The pandemic is considered unanimously as a major factor in causing the recession. The pandemic has affected nearly every major industry negatively, was one of the main causes of the stock market crash and has resulted in major restrictions of social liberties and movement.[77][78][79][80][81]\n The COVID-19 crisis affected worldwide economic activity, resulting in a 7% drop in global commercial commerce in 2020. While GVCs have persisted, several demand and supply mismatches caused by the pandemic have resurfaced throughout the recovery period and have been spread internationally through trade.[82][83][84]\n During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses lost 25% of their revenue and 11% of their workforce, with contact-intensive sectors and SMEs being particularly heavily impacted. However, considerable policy assistance helped to avert large-scale bankruptcies, with just 4% of enterprises declaring for insolvency or permanently shutting at the time of the COVID wave.[82]\n Aid to people and businesses in the form of employment retention schemes, subsidies, tax relief, and loan guarantee programs totalled roughly 9% of GDP, with substantial cross-country variance, which might reflect policy space and development levels. In the face of considerable liquidity challenges, debt moratoriums and revisions to bankruptcy rules also safeguarded businesses and people during the COVID-19 pandemic.[82][85]\n In response to the pandemic's infection rates and death toll, countries in the Western Balkans, the Eastern Neighborhood, and Central and Eastern Europe faced severe recessions.[82][86]\n While stay-at-home orders clearly affect many types of business, especially those that provide in-person services (including retail stores, restaurants and hotels, entertainment venues and museums, medical offices, and beauty salons and spas), government orders are not the sole pressure on those businesses. In the United States, people began to change their economic behavior 10–20 days before their local governments declared stay-at-home orders,[87] and by May, changes in individuals' rates of movement (according to smartphone data) did not always correlate with local laws.[88][89][non-primary source needed][90] According to a 2021 study, only 7% of the decline in economic activity was due to government-imposed restrictions on activity; the vast majority of the decline was due to individuals voluntarily disengaging from commerce.[91]\n The reduction in the demand for travel and the lack of factory activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted demand for oil, causing its price to fall.[92] The Russian–Saudi Arabia oil price war further worsened the recession, due to it crashing the price of oil. In mid-February, the International Energy Agency forecasted that oil demand growth in 2020 would be the smallest since 2011.[93] A slump in Chinese demand resulted in a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to discuss a potential cut in production to balance the loss in demand.[94] The cartel initially made a tentative agreement to cut oil production by 1.5 million barrels per day following a meeting in Vienna on 5 March 2020, which would bring the production levels to the lowest it has been since the Iraq War.[95]\n After OPEC and Russia failed to agree on oil production cuts on 6 March and Saudi Arabia and Russia both announced increases in oil production on 7 March, oil prices fell by 25 percent.[96][97] On 8 March, Saudi Arabia unexpectedly announced that it would increase production of crude oil and sell it at a discount (of $6–8 a barrel) to customers in Asia, the US, and Europe, following the breakdown of negotiations, as Russia resisted calls to cut production. The biggest discounts targeted Russian oil customers in northwestern Europe.[98]\n Prior to the announcement, the price of oil had gone down by more than 30% since the start of the year, and upon Saudi Arabia's announcement, it dropped a further 30 percent, though later recovered somewhat.[99][100] Brent Crude, an oil market used to price two-thirds of the world's crude oil supplies, experienced the largest drop since the 1991 Gulf War on the night of 8 March. Concurrently, the price of West Texas Intermediate, another market used as a benchmark for global oil prices, fell to its lowest level since February 2016.[101] Energy expert Bob McNally noted, \"This is the first time since 1930 and '31 that a massive negative demand shock has coincided with a supply shock;\"[102] in that case it was the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act precipitating a collapse in international trade during the Great Depression, coinciding with discovery of the East Texas Oil Field during the Texas oil boom. Fears surrounding the Russian–Saudi Arabian oil price war caused a plunge in U.S. stocks, and have had a particular impact on American producers of shale oil.[103]\n In early April 2020, Saudi Arabia and Russia both agreed to cut their oil production.[104][105] Reuters reported that \"If Saudi Arabia failed to rein in output, US senators called on the White House to impose sanctions on Riyadh, pull out US troops from the kingdom and impose import tariffs on Saudi oil.\"[106] The price of oil briefly went negative on 20 April 2020.[107]\n The 2020 stock market crash began on 20 February 2020, although the economic aspects of the COVID-19 recession began to materialize in late 2019.[108][109][110] Due to COVID-19 lockdowns, global markets, banks and businesses were all facing crises not seen since the Great Depression in 1929.[citation needed]\n From 24 to 28 February, stock markets declined the most in a week since the financial crisis of 2007–2008,[111][112][113] thus entering a correction.[114][115][116] Global markets into early March became extremely volatile, with large swings occurring.[117][118] On 9 March, most global markets reported severe contractions, mainly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and an oil price war between Russia and the OPEC countries led by Saudi Arabia.[119][120] This became colloquially known as Black Monday I, and at the time was the worst drop since the Great Recession in 2008.[121][122]\n Three days after Black Monday I there was another drop, Black Thursday, where stocks across Europe and North America fell more than 9%. Wall Street experienced its largest single-day percentage drop since Black Monday in 1987, and the FTSE MIB of the Borsa Italiana fell nearly 17%, becoming the worst-hit market during Black Thursday.[123][124][125] Despite a temporary rally on 13 March (with markets posting their best day since 2008), all three Wall Street indexes fell more than 12% when markets re-opened on 16 March.[126][127] During this time, one benchmark stock market index in all G7 countries and 14 of the G20 countries had been declared to be in Bear markets.[citation needed]\n Prior to opening, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures market experienced a 1,300-point drop based on the pandemic and fall in the oil price described above, triggering a trading curb, or circuit breaker, that caused the futures market to suspend trading for 15 minutes.[128] This predicted 1,300-point drop on 9 March would be among the most points the Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped in a single day.[129][130] When the market opened on 9 March, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1800 points on opening, 500 points lower than the prediction.[131]\n The United States' Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 2000 points,[132] described by The News International as \"the biggest ever fall in intraday trading\".[133] The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a number of trading \"circuit breakers\" to curb panicked selling.[128] Oil firms Chevron and ExxonMobil fell about 15%.[134] The Nasdaq Composite, also in the United States, lost over 620 points.[clarification needed] The S&P 500 fell by 7.6%.[135] Oil prices fell 22%,[136] and the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities fell below 0.40% and 1.02% respectively.[137] Canada's S&P/TSX Composite Index finished the day off by more than 10%.[138] Brazil's IBOVESPA gave up 12%, erasing over 15 months of gains for the index.[139] Australia's ASX 200 lost 7.3%—its biggest daily drop since 2008,[140][141] though it rebounded later in the day. London's FTSE 100 lost 7.7%, suffering its worst drop since the 2008 financial crisis.[142][143] BP and Shell Oil experienced intraday price drops of nearly 20%[144] The FTSE MIB, CAC 40, and DAX tanked as well, with Italy affected the most as the COVID-19 pandemic in the country continues.

US stock markets suffered from the greatest single-day percentage fall since the 1987 stock market crash.[164] Following Black Monday three days earlier, Black Thursday was attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and a lack of investor confidence in US President Donald Trump after he declared a 30-day travel ban against the Schengen Area.[165] Additionally, the European Central Bank, under the lead of Christine Lagarde, decided to not cut interest rates despite market expectations,[166] leading to a drop in S&P 500 futures of more than 200 points in less than an hour.[167]\n Bank Indonesia announced open market purchases of Rp4 trillion (or $276.53 million) in government bonds,[168] while Bank Indonesia Governor Perry Warjiyo stated that Bank Indonesia's open market purchases of government bonds had climbed to Rp130 trillion on the year and Rp110 trillion since the end of January.[169] Despite declining to cut its deposit rate, the European Central Bank increased its asset purchases by €120 billion (or $135 billion),[170] while the Federal Reserve announced $1.5 trillion in open market purchases.[171] Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a A$17.6 billion fiscal stimulus package.[172] The Reserve Bank of India announced that it would conduct a six-month $2 billion currency swap for U.S. dollars,[173] while the Reserve Bank of Australia announced A$8.8 billion in repurchases of government bonds.[174] The Central Bank of Brazil auctioned $1.78 billion Foreign exchange spots.[175]\n Asia-Pacific stock markets closed down (with the Nikkei 225 of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the IDX Composite of the Indonesia Stock Exchange falling to more than 20% below their 52-week highs),[176][177][178] European stock markets closed down 11% (with the FTSE 100 Index on the London Stock Exchange, the DAX on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the CAC 40 on the Euronext Paris, and the FTSE MIB on the Borsa Italiana all closing more than 20% below their most recent peaks),[179][180] while the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down an additional 10% (eclipsing the one-day record set on 9 March), the NASDAQ Composite was down 9.4%, and the S&P 500 was down 9.5% (with the NASDAQ and S&P 500 also falling to more than 20% below their peaks), and the declines activated the trading curb at the New York Stock Exchange for the second time that week.[181][182] Oil prices dropped by 8%,[183] while the yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities increased to 0.86% and 1.45% (and their yield curve finished normal).[184]\n The US's Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 Index suffered from the greatest single-day percentage fall since the 1987 stock market crash, as did the UK's FTSE 100, which fell 10.87%.[185] The Canadian S&P/TSX Composite Index dropped 12%, its largest one-day drop since 1940.[186] The FTSE MIB Italian index closed with a 16.92% loss, the worst in its history.[187] Germany's DAX fell 12.24% and France's CAC 12.28%.[188] In Brazil, the IBOVESPA plummeted 14.78%, after trading in the B3 was halted twice within the intraday;

as of May 2020, China was considering granting deadline extensions for repayment, and in June 2020, Chinese leader Xi Jinping said that some interest-free loans to certain countries would be forgiven.[223][224]\n Botswana has been affected by sharp falls in the diamond trade, tourism and other sectors.[225]\n The Economy of Egypt suffered from the COVID-19 recession. Tourism, which employs one in ten Egyptians and contributes about 5% of the GDP, has largely stopped, while remittances from migrant workers abroad (9% of GDP) are also expected to fall.[226] The cheap fuel prices and slower demand have also led some shipping companies to avoid the Suez Canal, and instead opt for traveling by the Cape of Good Hope, leading to reduced transit fees for the government.[226] However, despite this, Egypt were one of the few African countries to have a positive growth rate during the recession.\n Ethiopia is heavily dependent for export income on its national carrier, Ethiopian Airlines, which has announced suspensions on 80 flight routes.[225] Exports of flowers and other agricultural products have dropped sharply.[225]\n Namibia's central bank sees the nation's economy shrinking by 6.9%[227] This will be the biggest shrink of GDP since its independence in 1990. The tourism and hospitality industries has accounted for N$26 billion being lost as 125 000 jobs have been affected.[228] The central bank also announced that the diamond-mining sector will decline by 14.9% in 2020, while uranium mining may shrink 22%.[227]\n Zambia faced a severe debt crisis.[229] Almost half the national budget goes towards interest payments, with questions about whether the country will be able to make all future payments.[229]\n Argentina entered its 9th sovereign default in history due to the recession.[230] The government has proposed taking over one of the largest agroexporting companies Vicentín S.A.I.C after it incurred in a debt of more than $1.35 billion.[231]\n The fall in travel was expected to drive Belize into a deep recession in 2020.[225]In 2020, the economy contracted 13.4% with the sharpest declines observed in net foreign demand and private consumption. On an annualized base, the unemployment rate increased 19.1% from September 2019 to September 2020.[232]\n The Brazilian government forecast that its economy will experience its biggest crash since 1900, with a gross domestic product contraction of 4.7%.[233]\nAt the first trimester of 2020 the gross domestic product was 1.5% smaller than the GDP of the first trimester of 2019, and it decreased to the same level of 2012.[234]\nOn 9 April 2020, at least 600,000 businesses went bankrupt, and 9 million people were fired.[235]\n Even with the pandemic, the state of São Paulo was the only Brazilian state to see a GDP growth in 2020, of about 0.4%.[236]\n Total unemployment increased by 3 million and total hours worked fell by 30% between February and April 2020. Canadian manufacturing sales in March fell to the lowest level since mid-2016, as sales by auto manufacturers and parts suppliers plunged more than 30%.[237]\n In response, the government of Canada introduced several benefits, including the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, the Canada Emergency Student Benefit, and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy.[238]\n By June 2020, the national unemployment rate in Canada was 12.5%, down from 13.7% in May.[239]\n Mexico's outlook was already poor before the COVID-19 pandemic, with a mild recession in 2019.[240] The economic development plans of president Andrés Manuel López Obrador were predicated on revenue from the state oil company Pemex, but the oil price collapse has now raised doubts on those plans.[240] Beyond oil, the country's economy also relies on tourism, trade with the United States, as well as remittances, which all are also being affected.[241] All of this leading to what could be Mexico's worst recession in a century, and the worst in Latin America after Venezuela.[241] Beside this prediction, Mexico's economy shrinking in 2020 was less than that of Venezuela, Peru, Panama, Argentina and equal to that of Ecuador.[242]\n The National Bureau of Economic Research, considered the arbiter of recession declarations, found the United States recession began in February 2020 and ended roughly two months later, in April 2020, making it the shortest recession on records dating to 1854.[243][244]\n Before the pandemic, there were signs of recession. The US yield curve inverted in mid-2019, usually indicative of a forthcoming recession.[245][246]\n Starting in March 2020, job loss was rapid. About 16 million jobs were lost in the United States in the three weeks ending on 4 April.[247] Unemployment claims reached a record high, with 3.3 million claims made in the week ending on 21 March. (The previous record had been 700,000 from 1982.)[248][249] The week ending 28 March, however, unemployment claims set another record at 6.7 million and by 13 May, new claims had topped 35 million.[250] On 8 May, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a U-3 unemployment (official unemployment) figure of 14.7%, the highest level recorded since 1941, with U-6 unemployment (total unemployed plus marginally attached and part-time underemployed workers) reaching 22.8%.[251]\n For individual states, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported the highest U-3 unemployment occurred in April 2020 in Nevada (30.1%), Michigan (24.0%) and Hawaii (23.8%),[252] levels not seen since the Great Depression. This was followed by Rhode Island in April (18.1%), Massachusetts in June (17.7%), and Ohio in April (17.6%).[252] By December 2020, unemployment rates for the highest three states were recovering: Nevada (9.2%), Michigan (7.5%), and Hawaii (9.3%), with seven other states having recovered to below 4.0%.[252] However, a high percentage of those gains may have been part-time work, job gains in May 2020 were reported to be 40% part-time.[253]\n Restaurant patronage fell sharply across the country,[254] and major airlines reduced their operations on a large scale.[255] The Big Three car manufacturers all halted production.[256] In April, construction of new homes dropped by 30%, reaching the lowest level in five years.[257]\n Approximately 5.4 million Americans lost their health insurance from February to May 2020 after losing their jobs.[258][259]\n The St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index increased sharply from below zero to 5.8 during March 2020.[260][261] The United States Department of Commerce reported that consumer spending fell by 7.5 percent during the month of March 2020. It was the largest monthly drop since record keeping began in 1959. As a result, the country's gross domestic product reduced at a rate of 4.8 percent during the first quarter of 2020.[262]\n The largest economic stimulus legislation in American history, a $2 trillion (~$2.32 trillion in 2023) package called the CARES Act, was signed into law on 27 March 2020.[263]\n The Congressional Budget Office reported in May 2020 that:\n The COVID recession increased wealth and racial inequality.[265] According to a study, the pandemic drove 8 million Americans into poverty between May and September 2020.[266] On 30 July 2020, it was reported that the U.S. 2nd quarter gross domestic product fell at an annualized rate of 33%.[267]\n The recession caused by COVID-19 is expected to be the worst in the history of Latin America.[268]\nLatin American countries are expected to fall into a \"lost decade\", with Latin America's GDP returning to 2010 levels, falling by 9.1%.\nThe amount by which the GDP is expected to fall per country is listed below.[269]\n Other sources may expect different figures.[270][271][272][273]\nIn Panama, COVID-19 is expected to subtract US$5.8 billion from Panama's GDP.[274] Aiding Chile's downfall is reduced demand for copper from the US and China, and an increase in price volatility, as consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.[275][269]\n Australia before the recession was suffering from an unusually severe and expensive bushfire season which damaged the economy and domestic trade routes.[276] Not only that, but Australia had experienced significant slowdown in their economic growth, with economists in late 2019 saying that Australia was 'teetering on the edge of a recession'.[277] As a result of this and the effects of the recession, analysts in Australia expected a deep recession with at least 10.0% of the able working population becoming unemployed according to the Australian treasury and at least a 6.7% GDP retraction according to the IMF.[278][279] In April 2020, a water consultant predicted a shortage of rice and other staples during the pandemic unless farmers' water allocations were changed.[280]\n The unemployment level of 5.1% was projected to rise to a 25-year high of 10.0%, according to Treasury data released in April 2020.[281][282] The JobSeeker Payment unemployment benefit had an A$550 per fortnight Coronavirus Supplement added to it from April to September, when it reduced to A$250, then to A$150 after 31 December. The Supplement ceased on 31 March 2021.[283][284]\n As of April 2020, up to a million people have been laid off due to effects of the recession.[285] Over 280,000 individuals applied for unemployment support at the peak day.[286]\n On 23 July 2020, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg delivered a quarterly budget update stating the government had implemented a $289 billion (~$335 billion in 2023) economic support package. As a result, the 2020–21 budget will record a $184 billion (~$213 billion in 2023) deficit, the largest since WWII. Australia will maintain their triple A credit rating. Net debt will increase to $677.1 billion (~$751 billion in 2023) at 20 June 2021. Further, real GDP was forecast to have fallen sharply by 7% in the June quarter with unemployment anticipated to peak at 9.25% in the December quarter. However, due to the further reinstatement of restrictions on Victoria, notably stage 4 restrictions, national unemployment was expected to reach 11%.[citation needed]\n In August 2020, national unemployment peaked at 7.5%,[287] falling to 5.6% by April 2021.[288] In December 2020, it was announced Australia had pulled out of recession after experiencing a 3.3% growth in GDP in the September quarter. Treasurer Frydenberg however stated the effects of the recession has had lasting impacts and the recovery is far from over. Australia is set to avoid an economic depression as once forecast earlier in the year, though GDP is still likely to have experienced a contraction from 2019 figures.[289]\n Bangladesh is one of the few countries who had a generally positive gdp growth during the pandemic.[290] The Bangladeshi economy is heavily dependent on the garment industry and remittances from migrant workers.[291] The garment industry has been heavily affected, having already been contracting in 2019.[291] Remittances in turn expected to fall 22 percent.[291]\n As a result of the recession, China's economy contracted for the first time in almost 50 years.[292] The national GDP for the first quarter of 2020 dropped 6.8% year-on-year, 10.0% quarter on quarter, and the GDP for Hubei Province dropped 39.2% in the same period.[293]\n In May 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that, for the first time in history, the central government would not set an economic growth target for 2020, with the economy having contracted by 6.8% compared to 2019 and China facing an \"unpredictable\" time. However, the government also stated an intention to create 9 million new urban jobs until the end of 2020.[294]\n In October 2020, it was announced that China's third-quarter GDP has grown with 4.9%, hereby missing analysts expectations (which was set at 5.2%). However, it does show that China's economy has indeed been steadily recovering from the coronavirus shock that caused decades-low growth.[295] To fuel economic growth, the country set aside hundreds of billions of dollars for major infrastructure projects and used population tracking policies and enforced the stringent lockdown to contain the virus.[296] It is the only major economy that is expected to grow in 2020, according to the International Monetary Fund.[297]\n By December 2020, China's economic recovery was accelerating amid increasing demand for manufactured goods.[298] The UK-based Centre for Economics and Business Research projected that China's \"skilful management of the pandemic\" would cause the Chinese economy to surpass the United States and become the world's largest economy by nominal GDP in 2028, five years sooner than previously expected.[299][300] China's economy expanded by 2.3% in 2020.[301]\n In the first quarter of 2020, China's economy shrank by 6.8% due to the nationwide lockdown at the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. With the help of strict virus containment measures and emergency corporate relief, the economy has steadily recovered since the pandemic. China's economy grew by a record 18.3 percent in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the same period last year.[302]\n The urban unemployment rate reached a 21-month all-time high of 6.1% in April 2022 amid the impact of the epidemic.[303]\n Korea's gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in the second quarter of 2020 fell 3.3 percent from the previous quarter. This is the second consecutive quarter of negative growth following the first quarter (−1.3 percent). It was the lowest performance in 22 years and three months since the first quarter of 1998 (−6.8 percent) after the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Experts cited exports, which account for 40 percent of the Korean economy, as the worst performance report in 57 years since 1963, as the main factor for negative growth.[304]\n The employment market situation is also a big blow. According to the National Statistical Office, the number of employed people decreased by more than 350,000 in June from a year earlier due to the shock of the job market caused by the spread of COVID-19. The unemployment rate soared to the highest since 1999 when the statistics began to be compiled. In particular, the number of economically active young people decreased a lot, and the number of unemployed reached 1.66 million, up 120,000 from a year earlier.[304]\n The Korean economy exhibited relatively low real GDP growth prior to the spread of the virus caused by COVID-19 (1%). The already sluggish economy led Korea to experience a contraction of its real GDP during the first half of 2020, with a decline of 1.28% in the first quarter and a contraction of 2.74% in the second quarter, indicating a recession. After reaching a trough in the second quarter, the economy began to recover, showing an expansion of 2.2% in the third quarter. The year ended with a growth of 1.6% in the fourth quarter, which remained relatively stable at 1.5% during the first quarter of 2021.[305] Even though recessions are often accompanied by unemployment the Korean labor market showed low fluctuations during and after the recession as moderately higher levels of unemployment lagged behind economic activity. By the end of the second quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate has increase by less than a percentage point compare to October 2019 (3.5%) to 4.2%.[306] This relatively stable trend in the labor market continued through the third and fourth quarter, with unemployment  peaking at 4.8% in January 2021. Changes in the business cycle in Korea during the Covid recession reinforced the near zero inflation rates observed the last quarter of 2019, consistent with the slow economic growth at the onset of the recession. This low inflation persisted during the first quarter of 2020 and in the second quarter, the economy experienced a minor deflation, with a negative inflation rate of 0.21%, likely due to the continuous deflation in energy prices. In the first quarter of 2020, the energy inflation huber around -7.8% during the first two months, but it fell to -10.22% in May. [307]\n On 18 March, the Reserve Bank of Fiji reduced its overnight policy rate (OPR)[a] and predicted the domestic economy to fall into a recession after decades of economic growth.[308] Later on 25 June, the national bank predicted the Fijian economy to contract severely this year due to falling consumption and investment associated with ongoing job-losses.[309] Annual inflation remained in negative territory in May (−1.7%) and is forecast to edge up to 1.0 percent by year-end.[310]\n The IMF predicted the growth rate of India in the financial year of 2020–21 as 1.9%,[311] but in the following financial year, they predict it to be 7.4%.[312] IMF also predicted that India and China are the only two major economies that will maintain positive growth rates.[313] However the prediction later turned out to be wrong.[citation needed]\n On 24 June 2020, IMF revised India's growth rate to −4.5%, a historic low. However, IMF said India's economy is expected to bounce back in 2021 with a robust six percent growth rate.[citation needed]\n On 31 August 2020, the National Statistical Office (NSO) released the data, which revealed that the country's GDP contracted by 23.9 per cent in the first quarter of 2020–21 financial year. The economic contraction followed the severe lockdown to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, where an estimated 140 million jobs were lost. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, it was the worst fall in history.\n[314]\n In the last quarter of 2019, around the time when concerns for the upcoming coronavirus pandemic were coming to light, the Indonesian economy was shown to be already weakened. For example, the year 2019 ended with only an increase of 1.1% in GDP for Indonesia within the last quarter.[315] The early months following 2020 were when the coronavirus pandemic truely started to affect countries around the globe. Indonesia’s economy was no different, immediately showing evidence of undergoing a recession during the first half of the year. The economy’s GDP dropped by 0.6% in 2020’s first quarter and hit a trough at 6.9% contraction during the second quarter. While the contraction was a big hit to the economy, compared to the massive contractions other countries faced during COVID-19. Indonesia was still doing quite well. During the third quarter, Indonesia’s economy seemed to recover slightly, experiencing a 3.3% expansion of real GDP. The last quarter of 2020 remained not that impressive, with the GDP increasing by 2.2%.[316] These slight expansions in Indonesia’s economy are quite low, and it is evident that the economy continued to remain weak after the initial major hit of the global pandemic. Across the end of 2019 and the year 2020, the inflation rate that Indonesia’s economy experienced remained quite low and consistent. Noticeably, the Inflation rate during the last quarter of 2019 and the first half of 2020 had the largest increase, consisting of around a 2.7% increase on the low end with a 3.1% at the high end. [317] However, for the rest of the months that followed, inflation remained at around 1% and 1.7% for the rest of 2020; following the consistency of low and non-dramatic GDP that Indonesia experienced. [317]\n As 90% of the government income comes from oil, it will be extremely heavily hit by the drop in prices.[240]\n The employment market has also taken a huge hit. The excessive dependence on oil exposes the country to macroeconomic volatility. As of January 2021, Iraq's unemployment rate was more than 10 percentage points higher than its pre-COVID-19 level of 12.7%.[318]\n In Japan, the 2019 4th quarter GDP shrank 7.1% from the previous quarter[319] due to two main factors. One is the government's raise in consumption tax from 8% to 10% despite opposition from the citizens. The other is the devastating effects of Typhoon Hagibis, the strongest typhoon in decades to strike mainland Japan. It was the costliest Pacific typhoon on record.[320] Japanese exports to South Korea were also negatively affected by the Japan–South Korea trade dispute, lowering aggregate demand and GDP growth. This all adds to the effect of the pandemic on people's lives and the economy, the prime minister unveiling a 'massive\" stimulus amounting to 20% of GDP.[321]\n Since August 2019, Lebanon had been experiencing a major economic crisis that was caused by an increase in the official exchange rate between the Lebanese pound and the United States dollar.[322][323] This was further escalated by a large explosion in Beirut, which delivered critical damage to the Port of Beirut, harming Lebanese trade, and protests throughout the country.\n As millions of Nepalis work outside of the country, at least hundreds of thousands are expected to return due to layoffs abroad, in what has been labelled a \"crisis\" that may \"overwhelm the Nepali state\".[324]\n In April 2020, the New Zealand Treasury projected that the country could experience an unemployment rate of 13.5 percent if the country remained in lockdown for four weeks, with a range of 17.5 and 26 percent if the lockdown was extended. Prior to the lockdown, the unemployment rate was at 4.2%. Finance Minister Grant Robertson vowed that the Government would keep the unemployment rate below 10%.[325][326][327] In the second quarter of 2020, unemployment fell 0.2 percentage points to 4 percent; however, the under-use rate (a measure of spare capacity in the labor market) rose to a record 12 percent, up 1.6 percentage points from the previous quarter, and working hours fell by 10 percent.[328]\n The GDP of New Zealand contracted 1.6 percent in the first quarter of 2020.[329] The country officially entered a recession after a GDP contraction of 12.2% in the second quarter of 2020 which was reported by Statistics New Zealand in September.[330][331]\n The Philippines' real GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2020, the first contraction since the fourth quarter of 1998, a year after the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[332] The economy slipped in technical recession after a 16.5% decline was recorded in the second quarter.[333]\n The government projects that the GDP will contract by 5.5% in 2020. The First Metro Investment Corp projects a year-on-year GDP decline of 8–9%. The decline is led by a decrease in household spending which typically accounts for 70% of the country's GDP and hesitancy on spending due to COVID-19 community quarantine measures.[334]\n In its annual economic performance report released on 28 January 2021, the Philippine Statistics Authority reported that the Philippines' GDP contracted by 9.5% in 2020, its worst contraction since World War II. The last full-year contraction was during the 1997 Asian financial crisis where the GDP grew by −0.5%. The 2020 contraction was also worse than the 7% contraction in 1984.[335]\n Property investment sales in Singapore fell 37 per cent to $3.02 billion in the first quarter of this year from the previous three months as the pandemic took its toll on investor sentiment, a report from Cushman & Wakefield on 13 April showed.[336]\n On 28 April, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in its latest half-yearly macroeconomic review Singapore will enter into a recession this year because of the blow from the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in job losses and lower wages, with \"significant uncertainty\" over how long and intense the downturn will be. Depending on how the pandemic evolves and the efficacy of policy responses around the world, Singapore's economic growth could even dip below the forecast range of minus four to minus one per cent to record its worst-ever contraction.[337]\n On 29 April, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that total employment excluding foreign domestic workers dropped by 19,900 in the first three months of the year, mainly due to a significant reduction in foreign employment. Among Singapore citizens, the unemployment rate increased from 3.3 per cent to 3.5 per cent, while the resident unemployment rate, which includes permanent residents, increased from 3.2 per cent to 3.3 per cent.[338]\n On 14 May, Singapore Airlines (SIA) posted its first annual net loss in 48 years –  a net loss of S$732.4 million in the fourth quarter, reversing from a net profit of S$202.6 million in the corresponding quarter a year ago.[339]\n The European Purchasing Managers' Index, a key indicator of economic activity, crashed to a record-low of 13.5 in April 2020.[340] Normally, any figure below 50 is a sign of economic decline.[340]\n The Armenian economy shrank sharply by 7.6%, erasing all the gains from 2019.[341]\n The Belarusian economy is being negatively affected by the loss of Russian oil subsidies, and the drop in price of Belarus's refined oil products.[225]\n The Belgian economy exhibited low real GDP growth prior to the onset of the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. An already weakened economy, Belgium experienced a contraction of its real GDP during the first half of 2020 with a decline of 2.8% in the first quarter and an 11.4% contraction in the second quarter,[342]suggesting a recession. After a trough in the second quarter, the economy bounced back and experience an 11.8% expansion of its real GDP (insert OECD GDP link using the reference button). That recovery was followed by a minor contraction of 0.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a recovery the first quarter of 2021 with an economic expansion of about 2%.[343] Despite the instability of Belgium’s GDP in 2020, the labor market showed resilience avoiding a more significant decline as observed in other countries at the time. The unemployment rate in Belgium remained relatively steady during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the previous quarter and it only increased by about a percentage point in April 2024 compared to the 5.2% unemployment in October 2019.[344] The business cycle fluctuations of the Belgian economy did not bring significant changes to inflation rates which remained rather low since the end of 2019 and through 2020.[345]\n Czechia was very well established economically when heading into the late 2019 year and the early 2020 year. During the fourth quarter of 2019, their real GDP saw a small increase of 0.7% compared to the last quarter. Then like most countries, they hit the wall in the early quarters of 2020 with a decrease of 3.5% during the first quarter and a significantly larger decrease of 8.7% in the second quarter. After that difficult first half of the year, Czechia bounced back hard with a large increase of 7.4% in quarter three. Finally, as the year came to a close, they increased slightly by 1% heading into the 2021 year.[346] In opposition to the real GDP percentage, the unemployment rate didn’t vary too far from their average. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Czechia had an unemployment rate of 2.1%. With the events in 2020, Czechia managed to keep their unemployment rate even lower, with a percentage of 1.9%, in quarter one. \n\tConsequently, in the second quarter, there was an increase of 0.5% in the unemployment rate making it a 2.4% unemployment rate in the country. Just like in quarter two, we saw another increase of 0.4% during the quarter 3 with a total unemployment rate of 2.8%. Then to finish the year there was another slight increase, to 3.0% of unemployed people in Czechia.[347] Thirdly, looking at Czechia’s CPI to see the inflation/deflation of the country during this period. In the final quarter of 2019, Czechia experienced a CPI of 107.3, going into the new year. Czechia started the year with a CPI of 108.13 which is an increase from the year before meaning Czechia is facing slight inflation. In the second quarter, Czechia experienced a big deflation with a total CPI of 103.9, showing how quickly prices can change. In the third quarter, prices rose, yet again, with their CPI totaling 105.3. To finish off the year they went back to deflating with a total CPI of 103.5, their lowest of the year.[348]\n The Danish economy experienced low GDP growth before the coronavirus outbreak in 2020. The Danish economy contracted in quarter 1 of 2020 as the GDP growth transitioned from 0.4% in quarter 4 of 2019 to -0.8% in quarter 1 of 2020 due to the deadly pandemic. Following the dip in GDP in quarter 1 of 2020, another decline came in quarter 2 as it went from -0.8% to -5.9% which resulted in a deep recession.[349] The recessionary period in 2020 did not last long as the GDP growth skyrocketed from -5.9% in quarter 2 to 6.0% in quarter 3. Though Denmark's economy did manage to make it out of the recession, the rapid growth resulted in an expansion in quarter 3 of 2020 increasing inflation. In quarter 4 of 2020, the economy contracted from 6.0% to 0.0% dropping inflation slightly. The GDP of Denmark did rise somewhat in quarter 1 of 2021 to 0.9%.[350] Denmark experienced low inflation from 2019 to 2021, reaching a point where the economy experienced an inflation rate of 0% during the peak of the pandemic. This, in turn, caused deflation in the second quarter of 2020.[351] Denmark experienced a moderate to high unemployment rate. As of quarter 4 of 2019, it went from an unemployment rate of 5% to an unemployment rate of 6.4% in quarter 1 of 2021.[352] The GDP, unemployment rate, and inflation rate mirrors the fluctuating economy of Denmark displayed during the start, middle and end of the pandemic.\n France has been hit hard by the pandemic, with two months of 'strict lockdown' imposed before mid-year.[353] On 8 April 2020, the Bank of France declared that the French economy was in recession, shrinking by 6 percent in the first quarter of 2020.[354]\n At the end of the second trimester of 2020, several companies began staff cuts: Nokia (1233 jobs),[355] Renault (4600 jobs),[356] Air France (7580 jobs),[356] Airbus (5000 jobs),[356] Derichebourg (700 jobs),[357] TUI France (583 jobs)[358] and NextRadio TV (330–380 jobs).[358]\n Italy's unemployment rate is expected to rise to 11.2%, with 51% fearing unemployment in March.[359][360]\n The preliminary estimate of 1Q20 Italian GDP showed a 4.7% quarter on quarter fall (−4.8% YoY), a much steeper decline than in any quarter either during the Great Recession or the European debt crisis.[361]\n The Luxembourg economy exhibited low real GDP growth prior to the onset of the public health crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. An already weakened economy, Luxembourg experienced a contraction of its real GDP during the first half of 2020 with a decline of 1.2% in the first quarter and a 6.2% contraction in the second quarter, suggesting a recession. After a trough in the second quarter, the economy bounced back and experienced an 8.4% expansion of its real GDP in the third quarter. That recovery was followed by a minor contraction of 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2020.[362] Despite the instability of Luxembourg’s GDP in 2020, the labor market showed resilience, avoiding a more significant deterioration as observed in other countries at the time.\nThe unemployment rate in Luxembourg remained relatively steady during the first quarter of 2020 compared to the previous quarter and increased only slightly by about 0.4 percentage points in April 2020 compared to the 5.6% unemployment in October 2019. Subsequently to the contraction of GDP in the first quarter of 2020, the unemployment rate peaked at 7.5% in the second quarter, then decreased to 6.8% in the third quarter and 6.3% at the end of the year.[363]\n The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions to Spain’s economy, leading to significant downturns in key sectors. GDP shrank by -5.38% in Q1 2020 and -17.64% in Q2 2020, before partially rebounding with +16.24% in Q3 2020 as restrictions eased. Growth slowed again to +0.24% in Q4 2020 and +0.40% in Q1 2021, signaling a gradual stabilization.[365] Exports saw sharp declines, dropping -7.35% in Q1 2020 and -30.90% in Q2 2020, but recovered with +27.54% in Q3 2020, +4.89% in Q4 2020, and +0.73% in Q1 2021. Imports mirrored this pattern, falling by -4.35% in Q1 2020 and -28.23% in Q2 2020, followed by rebounds of +26.88% in Q3 2020, +5.99% in Q4 2020, and +2.60% in Q1 2021. Household consumption was highly volatile, contracting by -6.08% in Q1 2020 and -21.39% in Q2 2020, then bouncing back with +21.37% in Q3 2020, only to slightly increase by +0.23% in Q4 2020 and decrease again by -0.23% in Q1 2021.[366]  Investment in fixed capital dropped by -2.40% in Q1 2020 and -19.45% in Q2 2020, before recovering with +19.54% in Q3 2020, though it saw small declines in Q4 2020 (-0.17%) and Q1 2021 (-0.15%). Government consumption remained more stable, steadily growing by +1.12% in Q1 2020, +0.95% in Q2 2020, +1.48% in Q3 2020, +1.78% in Q4 2020, and +0.66% in Q1 2021. [367] These fluctuations underscore the pandemic’s deep and uneven impact on the economy, marked by sharp contractions followed by partial recoveries and ongoing volatility. Unemployment was rampant during these six quarters as Spain’s internal economy suffered.\n The Swiss economy showed modest real GDP growth in the final quarter of 2019, with a growth rate of 0.55%.[368] However, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant contraction of 1.4% in the first quarter of 2020, followed by a steep 6.6% decline in the second quarter, suggesting the start of a recession.[369] The economy rebounded in the third quarter of 2020 with a sharp 6.9% expansion, but growth slowed down in the fourth quarter to just 0.4%. In the first quarter of 2021, the economy grew by 0.3%. Despite the fluctuations in GDP, inflation remained subdued during this period.[370] Annual inflation in Switzerland was negative in every month from October 2019 to March 2021, with the lowest rate recorded in December 2020 at -0.81%.[371] The inflation rate was slightly less negative in early 2020, with a small positive change of 0.2% in January 2020, before dipping further in the months following.[372] Throughout this period, inflation remained low, signaling weak price pressures despite the economic challenges. Regarding unemployment, Switzerland saw a moderate rise in its unemployment rate during the pandemic. The unemployment rate remained relatively stable through early 2020, but by the end of the year, it increased from 4.4% in February 2020 to 5.1% in December 2020, reflecting the economic challenges posed by the crisis.[373] The unemployment rate remained around 5% throughout much of 2021 before gradually decreasing to 4.4% by the end of 2021.\n On 19 March 2020 the Bank of England cut the interest rate to a historic low of 0.1%.[374] Quantitative easing was extended by £200 billion to a total of £645 billion since the start of the Great Recession.[375] A day later, the Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak announced the government would spend £350 billion to bolster the economy.[376] On 24 March non-essential business and travel were officially banned in the UK to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.[377] In April the Bank agreed to extend the government's overdraft facility from £370 million to an undisclosed amount for the first time since 2008.[378] Household spending fell 41.2% in April 2020 compared with April 2019.[379] April's Purchasing Managers' Index score was 13.8 points, the lowest since records began in 1996, indicating a severe downturn of business activity.[380]\n By the start of May, 23% of the British workforce had been furloughed (temporarily laid off). Government schemes were launched to help furloughed employees and self-employed workers whose incomes had been affected by the outbreak, effectively paying 80% of their regular incomes, subject to eligibility.[381] The Bank estimated that the UK economy could shrink 30% in the first half of 2020 and that unemployment was likely to rise to 9% in 2021.[382] Economic growth was already weak before the COVID-19 pandemic, with 0% growth in the fourth quarter of 2019.[383] On 13 May, the Office for National Statistics announced a 2% fall in GDP in the first quarter of 2020, including a then-record 5.8% monthly fall in March. The Chancellor warned it was very likely the UK was going through a significant recession.[384]\n HSBC, which is based in London, reported $4.3 billion (~$4.99 billion in 2023) in pre-tax profits during the first half of 2020; this was only one-third of the profits it had taken in the first half of the previous year.[385]\n On 12 August, it was announced that the UK had entered into recession for the first time in 11 years.[386]\n During the pandemic, exports of many food and drink products from the UK declined significantly,[387] partly because the hospitality industry worldwide experienced a major slump.[388] According to news reports in February 2021, the Scotch whisky sector alone had experienced £1.1 billion in lost sales.[389]\n Tourism in the UK (by visitors from both the UK and from other countries) declined substantially due to travel restrictions and lockdowns. For much of 2020, and into 2021, vacation travel was not permitted and entry into the UK was very strictly limited. Business travel, for example, declined by nearly 90% over previous years.[390][391] This not only affected revenue from tourism but also led to numerous job losses.[392]\n In the Middle East, the economic situation in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia deteriorated more than any other country in the region. Relying highly on tourism, Dubai was one of the first to reopen tourism.[393] However, by January 2021, a significant surge in Covid cases in the UAE was observed, while several countries across the world also began to blame the Emirati city for spreading the virus abroad.[394]\n On the other hand, the economy of the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, faced a deep recession, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the second quarter, Saudi's economy shrank by 7 per cent, hitting both the oil and non-oil sectors. Besides, unemployment during the quarter also hit a record high of 15.4 per cent.[395] For the third quarter, the Kingdom didn't release its labor market report for the assessment of the unemployment rate. In January 2021, it was reported that Saudi was supposed to release the data on citizen unemployment in December 2020. However, it was delayed four times, before the officials permanently removed the release date from the Saudi statistics authority's website.[396]\n The Saudi economy was severely challenged from 2019 to 2020, and the global COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated its effects on major economic indicators. Unemployment in Saudi Arabia increased during this period. The unemployment rate in 2019 Q3  was around 12% for Saudi nationals, which went up to 15.4% in the second quarter of 2020. The pandemic, together with economic slowdowns especially in tourism, hospitality, and retail, brought about job losses, particularly among the younger generation of workers.[397]  In November 2019 Saudi Arabia inflation rate was -0.8%. Then in November of 2020 the inflation rate increased to 5.7%. During the pandemic the inflation grew about 4.9%. The country contracted by not producing and selling oil and products that people did not want to use during the pandemic.[398] Saudi Arabia GDP for 2020 was $734.27B, a 12.44% decline from 2019 which was $838.56B. GDP growth rate in 2019 Q4 was 0.9% and in 2020 Q4 the GDP grew to 1.5% which is an expansion to the economy GDP.  Overall, the Saudi Arabian economy had a turbulent year, with high unemployment, and significant GDP contraction amidst the global health crisis.[399]\n Various service sectors have been hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 recession.[400]\n New vehicle sales in the United States have declined by 40%.[401] The American Big Three have all shut down their US factories.[402] The Automotive industry in Germany suffered after having already suffered from the Volkswagen emissions scandal, as well as competition from electric cars.[403]\n The demand shock to oil was so severe that the price of American oil futures contracts became negative (bottoming out at $-37.63 per barrel on the West Texas Intermediate), as traders started paying for buyers to take the product before storage capacity ran out.[404] This was despite an earlier OPEC+ deal which cut world production by 10% and ended the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war.[405]\n The global tourism industry may shrink up to 50% due to the pandemic.[406]\n The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the restaurant business. In the beginning of March 2020, some major cities in the US announced that bars and restaurants would be closed to sit-down diners and limited to takeout orders and delivery.[407] Some employees were fired, and more employees lacked sick leave in the sector compared to similar sectors.[408][409]\n Shopping centers and other retailers around the world have reduced hours or closed down entirely. Many were expected not to recover, thereby accelerating the effects of the retail apocalypse.[410] Department stores and clothing shops have been especially hit.[410]\n The pandemic has had a significant impact on the aviation industry due to the resulting travel restrictions as well as slump in demand among travelers. Significant reductions in passenger numbers have resulted in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights.[citation needed]\n The following airlines have gone bankrupt or into administration:\n The cruise ship industry has also been heavily affected by a downturn, with the share prices of the major cruise lines down 70–80%.[415]\n Differences across occupations caused difference in the economic effects across groups. Certain jobs were less suitable for remote work, e.g. because they involve working with people closely or with particular materials. Women tended to be affected more than men.[416] The employment of immigrants in the U.S. declined more than for the native-born partly because the kinds of job immigrants held.[417] Inequity in economic impact on workers in similar professions occurred when employees laid-off completely were awarded both State unemployment benefits and up to $600/week in federal pandemic assistance –  which together could equal or exceed pre-layoff income –  while peers reduced to part-time employment struggled, ineligible for either unemployment insurance compensation or the accompanying pandemic payments.[citation needed]\n Unlike the Great Recession, it is expected that the COVID-19 recession will also affect the majority of developing nations. On 21 April, the United Nations World Food Programme warned that a famine \"of biblical proportions\" was expected in several parts of the world as a result of the pandemic.[418][419] The release of 2020 Global Report on Food Crises indicated that 55 countries were at risk,[420] with David Beasley estimating that in a worst-case scenario \"about three dozen\" countries would succumb to famine.[419][421] This is particularly an issue in several countries affected by war, including the Yemeni Civil War, the Syrian civil war, insurgency in the Maghreb and the Afghanistan Conflict and occurs on a background of the 2019 locust infestations in East Africa. Nestlé, PepsiCo, the United Nations Foundation and farmers' unions have written to the G20 for support in maintaining food distributions to prevent food shortages.[422] It is estimated that double the number of people \"will go hungry\" when compared to pre-pandemic levels.[422]\n The United Nations forecasts that the following member states will have significant areas with poor food security categorised as under \"stress\" (IPC phase 2), \"crisis\" (IPC phase 3), \"emergency\" (IPC phase 4) or \"critical emergency\" (IPC phase 5) in 2020:[420]\n It also raises alerts around:[420]\n On 9 July, Oxfam released a report warning that \"12,000 people per day could die from COVID-19 linked hunger\" by 2021, estimating an additional 125 million people are at risk of starvation due to the pandemic.[423][424] In particular the report highlighted \"emerging epicentres\" of hunger, alongside famine-stricken areas, including areas in Brazil, India, Yemen and the Sahel.[424]\n Several countries have announced stimulus programs to counter the effects of the recession. Below is a summary table based on data from the International Monetary Fund (unless otherwise specified).[225]\n \n",

        "title": "Financial crisis",
        "content": "\n Heterodox\n A financial crisis is any of a broad variety of situations in which some financial assets suddenly lose a large part of their nominal value. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, many financial crises were associated with banking panics, and many recessions coincided with these panics. Other situations that are often called financial crises include stock market crashes and the bursting of other financial bubbles, currency crises, and sovereign defaults.[1][2] Financial crises directly result in a loss of paper wealth but do not necessarily result in significant changes in the real economy (for example, the crisis resulting from the famous tulip mania bubble in the 17th century).\n Many economists have offered theories about how financial crises develop and how they could be prevented. There is little consensus and financial crises continue to occur from time to time. It is apparent however that a consistent feature of both economic (and other applied finance disciplines) is the obvious inability to predict and avert financial crises.[3] This realization raises the question as to what is known and also capable of being known (i.e. the epistemology) within economics and applied finance.  It has been argued that the assumptions of unique, well-defined causal chains being present in economic thinking, models and data, could, in part, explain why financial crises are often inherent and unavoidable.[4]\n When a bank suffers a sudden rush of withdrawals by depositors, this is called a bank run. Since banks lend out most of the cash they receive in deposits (see fractional-reserve banking), it is difficult for them to quickly pay back all deposits if these are suddenly demanded, so a run renders the bank insolvent, causing customers to lose their deposits, to the extent that they are not covered by deposit insurance. An event in which bank runs are widespread is called a systemic banking crisis or banking panic.[5]\n Examples of bank runs include the run on the Bank of the United States in 1931 and the run on Northern Rock in 2007.[6] Banking crises generally occur after periods of risky lending and resulting loan defaults.\n A currency crisis, also called a devaluation crisis,[7] is normally considered as part of a financial crisis. Kaminsky et al. (1998), for instance, define currency crises as occurring when a weighted average of monthly percentage depreciations in the exchange rate and monthly percentage declines in exchange reserves exceeds its mean by more than three standard deviations. Frankel and Rose (1996) define a currency crisis as a nominal depreciation of a currency of at least 25% but it is also defined as at least a 10% increase in the rate of depreciation. In general, a currency crisis can be defined as a situation when the participants in an exchange market come to recognize that a pegged exchange rate is about to fail, causing speculation against the peg that hastens the failure and forces a devaluation.[7]\n A speculative bubble (also called a financial bubble or an economic bubble) exists in the event of large, sustained overpricing of some class of assets.[8] One factor that frequently contributes to a bubble is the presence of buyers who purchase an asset based solely on the expectation that they can later resell it at a higher price, rather than calculating the income it will generate in the future. If there is a bubble, there is also a risk of a crash in asset prices: market participants will go on buying only as long as they expect others to buy, and when many decide to sell the price will fall. However, it is difficult to predict whether an asset's price actually equals its fundamental value, so it is hard to detect bubbles reliably. Some economists insist that bubbles never or almost never occur.[9]\n Well-known examples of bubbles (or purported bubbles) and crashes in stock prices and other asset prices include the 17th century Dutch tulip mania, the 18th century South Sea Bubble, the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the Japanese property bubble of the 1980s, and the crash of the United States housing bubble during 2006–2008.[10][11] The 2000s sparked a real estate bubble where housing prices were increasing significantly as an asset good.[12]\n When a country that maintains a fixed exchange rate is suddenly forced to devalue its currency due to accruing an unsustainable current account deficit, this is called a currency crisis or balance of payments crisis. When a country fails to pay back its sovereign debt, this is called a sovereign default. While devaluation and default could both be voluntary decisions of the government, they are often perceived to be the involuntary results of a change in investor sentiment that leads to a sudden stop in capital inflows or a sudden increase in capital flight.\n Several currencies that formed part of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism suffered crises in 1992–93 and were forced to devalue or withdraw from the mechanism. Another round of currency crises took place in Asia in 1997–98. Many Latin American countries defaulted on their debt in the early 1980s. The 1998 Russian financial crisis resulted in a devaluation of the ruble and default on Russian government bonds.\n Negative GDP growth lasting two or more quarters is called a recession. An especially prolonged or severe recession may be called a depression, while a long period of slow but not necessarily negative growth is sometimes called economic stagnation.\n Some economists argue that many recessions have been caused in large part by financial crises. One important example is the Great Depression, which was preceded in many countries by bank runs and stock market crashes. The subprime mortgage crisis and the bursting of other real estate bubbles around the world also led to recession in the U.S. and a number of other countries in late 2008 and 2009.\nSome economists argue that financial crises are caused by recessions instead of the other way around, and that even where a financial crisis is the initial shock that sets off a recession, other factors may be more important in prolonging the recession. In particular, Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argued that the initial economic decline associated with the crash of 1929 and the bank panics of the 1930s would not have turned into a prolonged depression if it had not been reinforced by monetary policy mistakes on the part of the Federal Reserve,[13] a position supported by Ben Bernanke.[14]\n It is often observed that successful investment requires each investor in a financial market to guess what other investors will do. Reflexivity refers to the circular relationships often evident in social systems between cause and effect – and relates to the property of self-referencing in financial markets.[15] George Soros has been a proponent of the reflexivity paradigm surrounding financial crises.[16] Similarly, John Maynard Keynes compared financial markets to a beauty contest game in which each participant tries to predict which model other participants will consider most beautiful.[17]\n Furthermore, in many cases, investors have incentives to coordinate their choices. For example, someone who thinks other investors want to heavily buy Japanese yen may expect the yen to rise in value, and therefore has an incentive to buy yen, too. Likewise, a depositor in IndyMac Bank who expects other depositors to withdraw their funds may expect the bank to fail, and therefore has an incentive to withdraw, too. Economists call an incentive to mimic the strategies of others strategic complementarity.[18]\n It has been argued that if people or firms have a sufficiently strong incentive to do the same thing they expect others to do, then self-fulfilling prophecies may occur.[19] For example, if investors expect the value of the yen to rise, this may cause its value to rise; if depositors expect a bank to fail this may cause it to fail.[20] Therefore, financial crises are sometimes viewed as a vicious circle in which investors shun some institution or asset because they expect others to do so.[21]  Reflexivity poses a challenge to the epistemic norms typically assumed within financial economics and all of empirical finance.[4] The possibility of financial crises being beyond the predictive reach of causality is discussed further within Epistemology of finance.\n Leverage, which means borrowing to finance investments, is frequently cited as a contributor to financial crises. When a financial institution (or an individual) only invests its own money, it can, in the very worst case, lose its own money. But when it borrows in order to invest more, it can potentially earn more from its investment, but it can also lose more than all it has. Therefore, leverage magnifies the potential returns from investment, but also creates a risk of bankruptcy. Since bankruptcy means that a firm fails to honor all its promised payments to other firms, it may spread financial troubles from one firm to another (see 'Contagion' below).\n For example, borrowing to finance investment in the stock market (\"margin buying\") became increasingly common prior to the Wall Street Crash of 1929.\n Another factor believed to contribute to financial crises is asset-liability mismatch, a situation in which the risks associated with an institution's debts and assets are not appropriately aligned. For example, commercial banks offer deposit accounts that can be withdrawn at any time, and they use the proceeds to make long-term loans to businesses and homeowners. The mismatch between the banks' short-term liabilities (its deposits) and its long-term assets (its loans) is seen as one of the reasons bank runs occur (when depositors panic and decide to withdraw their funds more quickly than the bank can get back the proceeds of its loans).[20] Likewise, Bear Stearns failed in 2007–08 because it was unable to renew the short-term debt it used to finance long-term investments in mortgage securities.\n In an international context, many emerging market governments are unable to sell bonds denominated in their own currencies, and therefore sell bonds denominated in US dollars instead. This generates a mismatch between the currency denomination of their liabilities (their bonds) and their assets (their local tax revenues), so that they run a risk of sovereign default due to fluctuations in exchange rates.[22]\n Many analyses of financial crises emphasize the role of investment mistakes caused by lack of knowledge or the imperfections of human reasoning. Behavioural finance studies errors in economic and quantitative reasoning. Psychologist Torbjorn K A Eliazon has also analyzed failures of economic reasoning in his concept of 'œcopathy'.[23]\n Historians, notably Charles P. Kindleberger, have pointed out that crises often follow soon after major financial or technical innovations that present investors with new types of financial opportunities, which he called \"displacements\" of investors' expectations.[24][25] Early examples include the South Sea Bubble and Mississippi Bubble of 1720, which occurred when the notion of investment in shares of company stock was itself new and unfamiliar,[26] and the Crash of 1929, which followed the introduction of new electrical and transportation technologies.[27] More recently, many financial crises followed changes in the investment environment brought about by financial deregulation, and the crash of the dot com bubble in 2001 arguably began with \"irrational exuberance\" about Internet technology.[28]\n Unfamiliarity with recent technical and financial innovations may help explain how investors sometimes grossly overestimate asset values. Also, if the first investors in a new class of assets (for example, stock in \"dot com\" companies) profit from rising asset values as other investors learn about the innovation (in our example, as others learn about the potential of the Internet), then still more others may follow their example, driving the price even higher as they rush to buy in hopes of similar profits. If such \"herd behaviour\" causes prices to spiral up far above the true value of the assets, a crash may become inevitable. If for any reason the price briefly falls, so that investors realize that further gains are not assured, then the spiral may go into reverse, with price decreases causing a rush of sales, reinforcing the decrease in prices.\n Governments have attempted to eliminate or mitigate financial crises by regulating the financial sector. One major goal of regulation is transparency: making institutions' financial situations publicly known by requiring regular reporting under standardized accounting procedures. Another goal of regulation is making sure institutions have sufficient assets to meet their contractual obligations, through reserve requirements, capital requirements, and other limits on leverage.\n Some financial crises have been blamed on insufficient regulation, and have led to changes in regulation in order to avoid a repeat. For example, the former Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, has blamed the financial crisis of 2007–2008 on 'regulatory failure to guard against excessive risk-taking in the financial system, especially in the US'.[29] Likewise, the New York Times singled out the deregulation of credit default swaps as a cause of the crisis.[30]\n However, excessive regulation has also been cited as a possible cause of financial crises. In particular, the Basel II Accord has been criticized for requiring banks to increase their capital when risks rise, which might cause them to decrease lending precisely when capital is scarce, potentially aggravating a financial crisis.[31]\n International regulatory convergence has been interpreted in terms of regulatory herding, deepening market herding (discussed above) and so increasing systemic risk.[32][33] From this perspective, maintaining diverse regulatory regimes would be a safeguard.\n Fraud has played a role in the collapse of some financial institutions, when companies have attracted depositors with misleading claims about their investment strategies, or have embezzled the resulting income. Examples include Charles Ponzi's scam in early 20th century Boston, the collapse of the MMM investment fund in Russia in 1994, the scams that led to the Albanian Lottery Uprising of 1997, and the collapse of Madoff Investment Securities in 2008.\n Many rogue traders that have caused large losses at financial institutions have been accused of acting fraudulently in order to hide their trades. Fraud in mortgage financing has also been cited as one possible cause of the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis; government officials stated on 23 September 2008 that the FBI was looking into possible fraud by mortgage financing companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, and insurer American International Group.[34] Likewise it has been argued that many financial companies failed in the recent crisis[clarification needed] because their managers failed to carry out their fiduciary duties.[35]\n Contagion refers to the idea that financial crises may spread from one institution to another, as when a bank run spreads from a few banks to many others, or from one country to another, as when currency crises, sovereign defaults, or stock market crashes spread across countries. When the failure of one particular financial institution threatens the stability of many other institutions, this is called systemic risk.[32]\n One widely cited example of contagion was the spread of the Thai crisis in 1997 to other countries like South Korea. However, economists often debate whether observing crises in many countries around the same time is truly caused by contagion from one market to another, or whether it is instead caused by similar underlying problems that would have affected each country individually even in the absence of international linkages.\n The nineteenth century Banking School theory of crises suggested that crises were caused by flows of investment capital between areas with different rates of interest. Capital could be borrowed in areas with low interest rates and invested in areas of high interest. Using this method a small profit could be made with little or no capital. However, when interest rates changed and the incentive for the flow was removed or reversed sudden changes in capital flows could occur. The subjects of investment might be starved of cash possibly becoming insolvent and creating a credit crunch and the loaning banks would be left with defaulting investors leading to a banking crisis.[36] As Charles Read has pointed out, the modern equivalent of this process involves the Carry Trade, see Carry (investment).[37]\n Some financial crises have little effect outside of the financial sector, like the Wall Street crash of 1987, but other crises are believed to have played a role in decreasing growth in the rest of the economy. There are many theories why a financial crisis could have a recessionary effect on the rest of the economy. These theoretical ideas include the 'financial accelerator', 'flight to quality' and 'flight to liquidity', and the Kiyotaki-Moore model. Some 'third generation' models of currency crises explore how currency crises and banking crises together can cause recessions.[38]\n Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek discussed the business cycle starting with Mises' Theory of Money and Credit, published in 1912.\n Recurrent major depressions in the world economy at the pace of 20 and 50 years have been the subject of studies since Jean Charles Léonard de Sismondi (1773–1842) provided the first theory of crisis in a critique of classical political economy's assumption of equilibrium between supply and demand. Developing an economic crisis theory became the central recurring concept throughout Karl Marx's mature work. Marx's law of the tendency for the rate of profit to fall borrowed many features of the presentation of John Stuart Mill's discussion Of the Tendency of Profits to a Minimum (Principles of Political Economy Book IV Chapter IV). The theory is a corollary of the Tendency towards the Centralization of Profits.\n In a capitalist system, successfully-operating businesses return less money to their workers (in the form of wages) than the value of the goods produced by those workers (i.e. the amount of money the products are sold for). This profit first goes towards covering the initial investment in the business. In the long-run, however, when one considers the combined economic activity of all successfully-operating business, it is clear that less money (in the form of wages) is being returned to the mass of the population (the workers) than is available to them to buy all of these goods being produced. Furthermore, the expansion of businesses in the process of competing for markets leads to an abundance of goods and a general fall in their prices, further exacerbating the tendency for the rate of profit to fall.\n The viability of this theory depends upon two main factors: firstly, the degree to which profit is taxed by government and returned to the mass of people in the form of welfare, family benefits and health and education spending; and secondly, the proportion of the population who are workers rather than investors/business owners. Given the extraordinary capital expenditure required to enter modern economic sectors like airline transport, the military industry, or chemical production, these sectors are extremely difficult for new businesses to enter and are being concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.\n Empirical and econometric research continues especially in the world systems theory and in the debate about Nikolai Kondratiev and the so-called 50-years Kondratiev waves. Major figures of world systems theory, like Andre Gunder Frank and Immanuel Wallerstein, consistently warned about the crash that the world economy is now facing.[citation needed] World systems scholars and Kondratiev cycle researchers always implied that Washington Consensus oriented economists never understood the dangers and perils, which leading industrial nations will be facing and are now facing at the end of the long economic cycle which began after the oil crisis of 1973.\n Hyman Minsky has proposed a post-Keynesian explanation that is most applicable to a closed economy. He theorized that financial fragility is a typical feature of any capitalist economy. High fragility leads to a higher risk of a financial crisis. To facilitate his analysis, Minsky defines three approaches that financing firms may choose, according to their tolerance of risk. They are hedge finance, speculative finance, and Ponzi finance. Ponzi finance leads to the most fragility.\n Financial fragility levels move together with the business cycle. After a recession, firms have lost much financing and choose only hedge, the safest. As the economy grows and expected profits rise, firms tend to believe that they can allow themselves to take on speculative financing. In this case, they know that profits will not cover all the interest all the time. Firms, however, believe that profits will rise and the loans will eventually be repaid without much trouble. More loans lead to more investment, and the economy grows further. Then lenders also start believing that they will get back all the money they lend. Therefore, they are ready to lend to firms without full guarantees of success.\n Lenders know that such firms will have problems repaying. Still, they believe these firms will refinance from elsewhere as their expected profits rise. This is Ponzi financing. In this way, the economy has taken on much risky credit. Now it is only a question of time before some big firm actually defaults. Lenders understand the actual risks in the economy and stop giving credit so easily. Refinancing becomes impossible for many, and more firms default. If no new money comes into the economy to allow the refinancing process, a real economic crisis begins. During the recession, firms start to hedge again, and the cycle is closed.\n The Banking School theory of crises describes a continuous cycle driven by varying interest rates. It is based on the work of Thomas Tooke, Thomas Attwood, Henry Thornton, William Jevons and a number of bankers opposed to the Bank Charter Act 1844.\n Starting at a time when short-term interest rates are low, frustration builds up among investors who search for a better yield in countries and locations with higher rates, leading to increased capital flows to countries with higher rates. Internally, short-term rates rise above long-term rates causing failures where borrowing at short term rates has been used to invest long-term where the funds cannot be liquidated quickly (a similar mechanism was implicated in the March 2023 failure of SVB Bank). Internationally, arbitrage and the need to stop capital flows, which caused bullion drains in the gold standard of the nineteenth century and drains of foreign capital later, bring interest rates in the low-rate country up to equal those in the country which is the subject of investment.\n The capital flows reverse or cease suddenly causing the subject of investment to be starved of funds and the remaining investors (often those who are least knowledgeable) to be left with devalued assets. Bankruptcies, defaults and bank failures follow as rates are pushed high. After the crisis governments push short-term interest rates low again to diminish the cost of servicing government borrowing which has been used to overcome the crisis. Funds build up again looking for investment opportunities and the cycle restarts from the beginning.[39]\n Mathematical approaches to modeling financial crises have emphasized that there is often positive feedback[40] between market participants' decisions (see strategic complementarity).[41] Positive feedback implies that there may be dramatic changes in asset values in response to small changes in economic fundamentals. For example, some models of currency crises (including that of Paul Krugman) imply that a fixed exchange rate may be stable for a long period of time, but will collapse suddenly in an avalanche of currency sales in response to a sufficient deterioration of government finances or underlying economic conditions.[42][43]\n According to some theories, positive feedback implies that the economy can have more than one equilibrium. There may be an equilibrium in which market participants invest heavily in asset markets because they expect assets to be valuable. This is the type of argument underlying Diamond and Dybvig's model of bank runs, in which savers withdraw their assets from the bank because they expect others to withdraw too.[20] Likewise, in Obstfeld's model of currency crises, when economic conditions are neither too bad nor too good, there are two possible outcomes: speculators may or may not decide to attack the currency depending on what they expect other speculators to do.[21]\n A variety of models have been developed in which asset values may spiral excessively up or down as investors learn from each other. In these models, asset purchases by a few agents encourage others to buy too, not because the true value of the asset increases when many buy (which is called \"strategic complementarity\"), but because investors come to believe the true asset value is high when they observe others buying.\n In \"herding\" models, it is assumed that investors are fully rational, but only have partial information about the economy. In these models, when a few investors buy some type of asset, this reveals that they have some positive information about that asset, which increases the rational incentive of others to buy the asset too. Even though this is a fully rational decision, it may sometimes lead to mistakenly high asset values (implying, eventually, a crash) since the first investors may, by chance, have been mistaken.[44][45][46][47] Herding models, based on Complexity Science, indicate that it is the internal structure of the market, not external influences, which is primarily responsible for crashes.[48]\n In \"adaptive learning\" or \"adaptive expectations\" models, investors are assumed to be imperfectly rational, basing their reasoning only on recent experience. In such models, if the price of a given asset rises for some period of time, investors may begin to believe that its price always rises, which increases their tendency to buy and thus drives the price up further. Likewise, observing a few price decreases may give rise to a downward price spiral, so in models of this type, large fluctuations in asset prices may occur. Agent-based models of financial markets often assume investors act on the basis of adaptive learning or adaptive expectations.\n As the most recent and most damaging financial crisis event, the Global financial crisis, deserves special attention, as its causes, effects, response, and lessons are most applicable to the current financial system.\n A noted survey of financial crises is This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly (Reinhart & Rogoff 2009), by economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, who are regarded as among the foremost historians of financial crises.[49] In this survey, they trace the history of financial crisis back to sovereign defaults – default on public debt, – which were the form of crisis prior to the 18th century and continue, then and now causing private bank failures; crises since the 18th century feature both public debt default and private debt default. Reinhart and Rogoff also class debasement of currency and hyperinflation as being forms of financial crisis, broadly speaking, because they lead to unilateral reduction (repudiation) of debt.\n Reinhart and Rogoff trace inflation (to reduce debt) to Dionysius I's rule in Syracuse and begin their \"eight centuries\" in 1258; debasement of currency also occurred under the Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire. A financial crisis in 33 A.D. caused by a contraction of money supply had been recorded by several Roman historians.[50]\n Among the earliest crises Reinhart and Rogoff studied is the 1340 default of England, due to setbacks in its war with France (the Hundred Years' War; see details). Further early sovereign defaults include seven defaults by the Spanish Empire, four under Philip II, three under his successors.\n Other global and national financial mania since the 17th century include:\n Specific:\n",

        "content": "GICS of components of the S&P 500 by market capitalization[4]\n The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500,[5] is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. It is one of the most commonly followed equity indices and includes approximately 80% of the total market capitalization of U.S. public companies, with an aggregate market cap of more than $43 trillion as of January 2024.[2][6]\n The S&P 500 index is a free-float weighted/capitalization-weighted index. As of September 30, 2024, the nine largest companies on the list of S&P 500 companies accounted for 34.6% of the market capitalization of the index and were, in order of highest to lowest weighting: Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet (including both class A & C shares), Berkshire Hathaway, Broadcom, and Tesla.[7] The components that have increased their dividends in 25 consecutive years are known as the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.[8]\n The index is one of the factors in computation of the Conference Board Leading Economic Index, used to forecast the direction of the economy.[9] The index is associated with many ticker symbols, including ^GSPC,[10] INX,[11] and $SPX, depending on market or website.[12] The S&P 500 is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture majority-owned by S&P Global, and its components are selected by a committee.[13][14]\n Index funds, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), can replicate, before fees and expenses, the performance of the index by holding the same stocks as the index in the same proportions. ETFs that replicate the performance of the index are issued by The Vanguard Group (NYSE Arca: VOO), iShares (NYSE Arca: IVV), and State Street Corporation (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust, NYSE Arca: SPY and NYSE Arca: SPLG). The most liquid based on average daily volume is (NYSE Arca: SPY), although SPY has a higher annual expense ratio of 0.09% compared to 0.03% for VOO and IVV, and 0.02% for SPLG. Mutual funds that track the index are offered by Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price, and Charles Schwab Corporation.[15][16]\n Direxion offers leveraged ETFs which attempt to produce three times the daily return of either investing in (NYSE Arca: SPXL) or shorting (NYSE Arca: SPXS) the S&P 500 index.[17] ProShares offers 2x daily return (NYSE Arca: SSO) and 3x daily return (NYSE Arca: UPRO).\n In the derivatives market, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) offers futures contracts that track the index and trade on the exchange floor in an open outcry auction, or on CME's Globex platform, and are the exchange's most popular product. The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) offers options on the S&P 500 index as well as on S&P 500 index ETFs, inverse ETFs, and leveraged ETFs.\n In 1860, Henry Varnum Poor formed Poor's Publishing, which published an investor's guide to the railroad industry.[18] In 1923, Standard Statistics Company (founded in 1906 as the Standard Statistics Bureau) began rating mortgage bonds[18] and developed its first stock market index consisting of the stocks of 233 U.S. companies, computed weekly.[1] Three years later, it developed a 90-stock index, computed daily.[1] In 1941, Poor's Publishing merged with Standard Statistics Company to form Standard & Poor's.[18][19]\n On Monday, March 4, 1957, the index was expanded to its current extent of 500 companies and was renamed the S&P 500 Stock Composite Index.[1] In 1962, Ultronic Systems became the compiler of the S&P indices including the S&P 500 Stock Composite Index, the 425 Stock Industrial Index, the 50 Stock Utility Index, and the 25 Stock Rail Index.[20] On August 31, 1976, The Vanguard Group offered the first mutual fund to retail investors that tracked the index.[1] On April 21, 1982, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange began trading futures based on the index.[1] On July 1, 1983, Chicago Board Options Exchange began trading options based on the index.[1] Beginning in 1986, the index value was updated every 15 seconds, or 1,559 times per trading day, with price updates disseminated by Reuters.[21]\n On January 22, 1993, the Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts exchange-traded fund issued by State Street Corporation began trading.[1] On September 9, 1997, CME Group introduced the S&P E-mini futures contract.[1] In 2005, the index transitioned to a public float-adjusted capitalization-weighting.[22] Friday, September 17, 2021, was the final trading date for the original SP big contract which began trading in 1982.[23]\n Like other indices managed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, but unlike indices such as the Russell 1000 Index which are strictly rule-based, the components of the S&P 500 index are selected by a committee. When considering the eligibility of a new addition, the committee assesses the company's merit using the following primary criteria:[3]\n A stock may rise in value when it is added to the index since index funds must purchase that stock to continue tracking the index.[27][28]\n In October 2021, Bloomberg News reported that a study alleged that some companies purchase ratings from S&P Global to increase their chances of entering the S&P 500 Index—even without meeting the full criteria for inclusion.[29]\n \n Since its inception in 1926, the index's compound annual growth rate—including dividends—has been approximately 9.8% (6% after inflation), with the standard deviation of the return over the same time period being 20.81%.[30] While the index has declined in several years by over 30%,[31] it has posted annual increases 70% of the time,[32] with 5% of all trading days resulting in record highs.[33]\n Returns are generally quoted as price returns (excluding returns from dividends). However, they can also be quoted as total return, which includes returns from dividends and the reinvestment thereof, and \"net total return\", which reflects the effects of dividend reinvestment after the deduction of withholding tax.[2]\n The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has been averaging an annual return rate of 14.61% since its inception in 2010. A $1000 invested in VOO in November 20, 2014 was worth a total of $3,328.10 10 years later at November 20, 2024 assuming the dividends were reinvested with DRIP. That’s an annual return of 13.52% and a total return of 232.81%.[34]\n",

It comprises 503 common stocks which are issued by 500 large-cap companies traded on the American stock exchanges (including the 30 companies that compose the Dow Jones Industrial Average). The index includes about 80 percent of the American market by capitalization. It is weighted by free-float market capitalization, so more valuable companies account for relatively more weight in the index. The index constituents and the constituent weights are updated regularly using rules published by S&P Dow Jones Indices. Although called the S&P 500, the index contains 503 stocks because it includes two share classes of stock from 3 of its component companies.[1][2]\n S&P Dow Jones Indices updates the components of the S&P 500 periodically, typically in response to acquisitions, or to keep the index up to date as various companies grow or shrink in value.[3] Between January 1, 1963, and December 31, 2014, 1,186 index components were replaced by other components.\n",

        "content": "\n The Nasdaq Stock Market (/ˈnæzdæk/ ⓘ; National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) is an American stock exchange based in New York City. It is the most active stock trading venue in the U.S. by volume,[3] and ranked second on the list of stock exchanges by market capitalization of shares traded, behind the New York Stock Exchange.[4] The exchange platform is owned by Nasdaq, Inc.,[5] which also owns the Nasdaq Nordic stock market network and several U.S.-based stock and options exchanges. Although it trades stock of healthcare, financial, media, entertainment, retail, hospitality, and food businesses, it focuses more on technology stocks. The exchange is made up of both American and foreign firms, with China and Israel being the largest foreign sources.[6]\n \"Nasdaq\" (originally and still commonly spelled with all-capital letters as \"NASDAQ\") was initially an acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations.[7] It was founded in 1971 by the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), now known as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.[8] On February 8, 1971, the NASDAQ stock market began operations as the world's first electronic stock market.[8] At first, it was merely a \"quotation system\" and did not provide a way to perform electronic trades.[9]\n The NASDAQ Stock Market eventually assumed the majority of major trades that had been executed by the over-the-counter (OTC) system of trading, but there are still many securities traded in this fashion. As late as 1987, the NASDAQ exchange was still commonly referred to as \"OTC\" in media reports[10] and also in the monthly Stock Guides (stock guides and procedures) issued by Standard & Poor's Corporation.[11] Over the years, it became more of a stock market by adding trade and volume reporting and automated trading systems. In 1981, NASDAQ traded 37% of the U.S. securities markets' total of 21 billion shares. By 1991, NASDAQ's share had grown to 46%.[12] In 1992, the NASDAQ Stock Market joined with the London Stock Exchange to form the first intercontinental linkage of capital markets.[13]\n In 1996, the SEC issued a report alleging that NASDAQ market makers fixed prices by avoiding \"odd-eighths\" quotes (at the time, stock prices were quoted in increments of an eighth of a dollar) to artificially widen spreads. The report was followed by a new set of rules for how NASDAQ handled orders.[14]: 102, 126 \n In 1998, it became the first stock market in the United States to trade online, using the slogan \"the stock market for the next hundred years\".[15] The NASDAQ Stock Market attracted many companies during the dot-com bubble.\n Its main index is the NASDAQ Composite, which has been published since its inception. The QQQ exchange-traded fund tracks the large-cap NASDAQ-100 index, which was introduced in 1985 alongside the NASDAQ Financial-100 Index, which tracks the largest 100 companies in terms of market capitalization.\n On March 10, 2000, the NASDAQ Composite stock market index peaked at 5,132.52, but fell to 3,227 by April 17,[16] and, in the following 30 months, fell 78% from its peak.[17]\n In a series of sales in 2000 and 2001, FINRA sold its stake in the NASDAQ. On July 2, 2002, NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. became a public company via an initial public offering.[18] In 2006, the status of the NASDAQ Stock Market was changed from a stock market to a licensed national securities exchange.[19] In 2007, it merged with OMX, a leading exchange operator in the Nordic countries, expanded its global footprint, and changed its name to the NASDAQ OMX Group.[20]\n To qualify for listing on the exchange, a company must be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), must have at least three market makers (financial firms that act as brokers or dealers for specific securities) and must meet minimum requirements for assets, capital, public shares, and shareholders.\n In February 2011, in the wake of an announced merger of NYSE Euronext with Deutsche Börse, speculation developed that NASDAQ OMX and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) could mount a counter-bid of their own for NYSE. NASDAQ OMX could be[when?] looking to acquire the American exchange's cash equities business, ICE the derivatives business. At the time, \"NYSE Euronext's market value was $9.75 billion. NASDAQ was valued at $5.78 billion, while ICE was valued at $9.45 billion.\"[21] Late in the month, NASDAQ was reported to be considering asking either ICE or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to join in what would probably have to be, if it proceeded, an $11–12 billion counterbid.[22]\n In December 2005, NASDAQ acquired Instinet for $1.9 billion, retaining the Inet ECN and subsequently selling the agency brokerage business to Silver Lake Partners and Instinet management.[23][24][25]\n The European Association of Securities Dealers Automatic Quotation System (EASDAQ) was founded as a European equivalent to the NASDAQ Stock Market. It was purchased by NASDAQ in 2001 and became NASDAQ Europe. In 2003, operations were shut down as a result of the burst of the dot-com bubble.[26] In 2007, NASDAQ Europe was revived first as Equiduct and was acquired by Börse Berlin later that year.[27]\n On June 18, 2012, NASDAQ OMX became a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative on the eve of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20).[28][29]\n In November 2016, chief operating officer Adena Friedman was promoted to chief executive officer, becoming the first woman to run a major exchange in the U.S.[30]\n In 2016, Nasdaq earned $272 million in listings-related revenues.[31]\n In October 2018, the SEC ruled that the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq did not justify the continued price increases when selling market data.[32][33][34]\n In December 2020, NASDAQ announced that it would strip its indexes of four Chinese companies in response to Executive Order 13959.[35]\n In September 2024, the European Commission said it had carried out an unannounced inspection at the offices of Nasdaq over potential anti-competitive practices.[36]\n Nasdaq 100 futures are traded on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) while its derivatives, E-Mini Nasdaq 100 and Micro E-Mini Nasdaq 100 futures are traded on the EMiniCME. Below are the contract specifications for the Nasdaq 100 and derivatives.\n Nasdaq quotes are available at three levels:\n The Nasdaq Stock Market sessions, with times in the Eastern Time Zone are:\n 7:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.: extended-hours trading session (premarket)\n 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.: normal trading session\n 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.: extended-hours trading session (postmarket)[42]\n The Nasdaq Stock Market averages about 253 trading days per year.[43]\n The Nasdaq Stock Market has three different market tiers:\n After the NYSE, Nasdaq is the second largest stock exchange in the United States with a market capitalization of $19 trillion, which is about $5.5 trillion less than the NYSE as of 2021.[49][50][51] Nasdaq is a much younger organization than the NYSE, having been founded in just 1971.[52][53] In addition to age and market capitalization, there are other key differences between the two exchanges:\n",

        "content": "\n A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto[a] is a digital currency designed to work through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.[2]\n Individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger or \"blockchain,\" which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, control the creation of additional coins, and verify the transfer of coin ownership.[3][4][5] Despite its name, which has come to describe many of the fungible blockchain tokens that have been created, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense, and varying legal treatments have been applied to them in various jurisdicitons, including classification as commodities, securities, and currencies. Cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice.[6][7][8] Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency.[clarification needed]\n The first cryptocurrency was bitcoin, which was first released as open-source software in 2009. As of June 2023, there were more than 25,000 other cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, of which more than 40 had a market capitalization exceeding $1 billion.[9]\n In 1983, American cryptographer David Chaum conceived of a type of cryptographic electronic money called ecash.[10][11] Later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash,[12] an early form of cryptographic electronic payments. Digicash required user software in order to withdraw notes from a bank and designate specific encrypted keys before they could be sent to a recipient. This allowed the digital currency to be untraceable by a third party.\n In 1996, the National Security Agency published a paper entitled How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash, describing a cryptocurrency system. The paper was first published in an MIT mailing list (October 1996) and later (April 1997) in The American Law Review.[13]\n In 1998, Wei Dai described \"b-money,\" an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.[14] Shortly thereafter, Nick Szabo described bit gold.[15] Like bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that would follow it, bit gold (not to be confused with the later gold-based exchange BitGold) was described as an electronic currency system that required users to complete a proof of work function with solutions being cryptographically put together and published.\n In January 2009, bitcoin was created by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto. It used SHA-256, a cryptographic hash function, in its proof-of-work scheme.[16][17] In April 2011, Namecoin was created as an attempt at forming a decentralized DNS. In October 2011, Litecoin was released, which used scrypt as its hash function instead of SHA-256. Peercoin, created in August 2012, used a hybrid of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake.[18]\n Cryptocurrency has undergone several periods of growth and retraction, including several bubbles and market crashes, such as in 2011, 2013–2014/15, 2017–2018, and 2021–2023.[19][20]\n On 6 August 2014, the UK announced its Treasury had commissioned a study of cryptocurrencies and what role, if any, they could play in the UK economy. The study was also to report on whether regulation should be considered.[21] Its final report was published in 2018,[22] and it issued a consultation on cryptoassets and stablecoins in January 2021.[23]\n In June 2021, El Salvador became the first country to accept bitcoin as legal tender, after the Legislative Assembly had voted 62–22 to pass a bill submitted by President Nayib Bukele classifying the cryptocurrency as such.[24]\n In August 2021, Cuba followed with Resolution 215 to recognize and regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.[25]\n In September 2021, the government of China, the single largest market for cryptocurrency, declared all cryptocurrency transactions illegal. This completed a crackdown on cryptocurrency that had previously banned the operation of intermediaries and miners within China.[26]\n On 15 September 2022, the world's second largest cryptocurrency at that time, Ethereum, transitioned its consensus mechanism from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) in an upgrade process known as \"the Merge\".  According to the Ethereum Founder, the upgrade would cut both Ethereum's energy use and carbon-dioxide emissions by 99.9%.[27]\n On 11 November 2022, FTX Trading Ltd., a cryptocurrency exchange, which also operated a crypto hedge fund, and had been valued at $18 billion,[28] filed for bankruptcy.[29] The financial impact of the collapse extended beyond the immediate FTX customer base, as reported,[30] while, at a Reuters conference, financial industry executives said that \"regulators must step in to protect crypto investors.\"[31] Technology analyst Avivah Litan commented on the cryptocurrency ecosystem that \"everything...needs to improve dramatically in terms of user experience, controls, safety, customer service.\"[32]\n According to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:[33]\n In March 2018, the word cryptocurrency was added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.[34]\n After the early innovation of bitcoin in 2008 and the early network effect gained by bitcoin, tokens, cryptocurrencies, and other digital assets that were not bitcoin became collectively known during the 2010s as alternative cryptocurrencies,[35][36][37] or \"altcoins\".[38]\nSometimes the term \"alt coins\" was used,[39][40] or disparagingly, \"shitcoins\".[41] Paul Vigna of The Wall Street Journal described altcoins in 2020 as \"alternative versions of Bitcoin\"[42] given its role as the model protocol for cryptocurrency designers. A Polytechnic University of Catalonia thesis in 2021 used a broader description, including not only alternative versions of bitcoin but every cryptocurrency other than bitcoin. \"As of early 2020, there were more than 5,000 cryptocurrencies.\n  Altcoins often have underlying differences when compared to bitcoin. For example, Litecoin aims to process a block every 2.5 minutes, rather than bitcoin's 10 minutes which allows Litecoin to confirm transactions faster than bitcoin.[18] Another example is Ethereum, which has smart contract functionality that allows decentralized applications to be run on its blockchain.[43] Ethereum was the most used blockchain in 2020, according to Bloomberg News.[44] In 2016, it had the largest \"following\" of any altcoin, according to the New York Times.[45]\n Significant market price rallies across multiple altcoin markets are often referred to as an \"altseason\".[46][47]\n Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable level of purchasing power.[48] Notably, these designs are not foolproof, as a number of stablecoins have crashed or lost their peg. For example, on 11 May 2022, Terra's stablecoin UST fell from $1 to 26 cents.[49][50] The subsequent failure of Terraform Labs resulted in the loss of nearly $40B invested in the Terra and Luna coins.[51] In September 2022, South Korean prosecutors requested the issuance of an Interpol Red Notice against the company's founder, Do Kwon.[52] In Hong Kong, the expected regulatory framework for stablecoins in 2023/24 is being shaped and includes a few considerations.[53]\n Memecoins are a category of cryptocurrencies that originated from Internet memes or jokes. The most notable example is Dogecoin, a memecoin featuring the Shiba Inu dog from the Doge meme.[54] Memecoins are known for extreme volatility; for example, the record-high value for a Dogecoin was 73 cents, but that had plunged to 13 cents by mid-2024.[54] Scams are prolific among memecoins.[54]\n Physical cryptocurrency coins have been made as promotional items and some have become collectibles.[55] Some of these have a private key embedded in them to access crypto worth a few dollars. There have also been attempts to issue bitcoin “bank notes”.[56]\n The term “physical bitcoin” is used in the finance industry when investment funds that hold crypto purchased from crypto exchanges put their crypto holdings in a specialised bank called a \"custodian\".[57]\n These physical representations of cryptocurrency do not hold any value by themselves; these are only utilized for collectable purposes.\n Cryptocurrency is produced by an entire cryptocurrency system collectively, at a rate that is defined when the system is created and that is publicly stated. In centralized banking and economic systems such as the US Federal Reserve System, corporate boards or governments control the supply of currency.[citation needed] In the case of cryptocurrency, companies or governments cannot produce new units and have not so far provided backing for other firms, banks, or corporate entities that hold asset value measured in it. The underlying technical system upon which cryptocurrencies are based was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.[58]\n Within a proof-of-work system such as bitcoin, the safety, integrity, and balance of ledgers are maintained by a community of mutually distrustful parties referred to as miners. Miners use their computers to help validate and timestamp transactions, adding them to the ledger in accordance with a particular timestamping scheme.[16] In a proof-of-stake blockchain, transactions are validated by holders of the associated cryptocurrency, sometimes grouped together in stake pools.\n Most cryptocurrencies are designed to gradually decrease the production of that currency, placing a cap on the total amount of that currency that will ever be in circulation.[59] Compared with ordinary currencies held by financial institutions or kept as cash on hand, cryptocurrencies can be more difficult for seizure by law enforcement.[3]\n The validity of each cryptocurrency's coins is provided by a blockchain. A blockchain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography.[58][60] Each block typically contains a hash pointer as a link to a previous block,[60] a timestamp, and transaction data.[61] By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data. It is \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\".[62] For use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires collusion of the network majority.\n Blockchains are secure by design and are an example of a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been achieved with a blockchain.[63]\n A node is a computer that connects to a cryptocurrency network. The node supports the cryptocurrency's network through either relaying transactions, validation, or hosting a copy of the blockchain. In terms of relaying transactions, each network computer (node) has a copy of the blockchain of the cryptocurrency it supports. When a transaction is made, the node creating the transaction broadcasts details of the transaction using encryption to other nodes throughout the node network so that the transaction (and every other transaction) is known.\n Node owners are either volunteers, those hosted by the organization or body responsible for developing the cryptocurrency blockchain network technology, or those who are enticed to host a node to receive rewards from hosting the node network.[64]\n Cryptocurrencies use various timestamping schemes to \"prove\" the validity of transactions added to the blockchain ledger without the need for a trusted third party.\n The first timestamping scheme invented was the proof-of-work scheme. The most widely used proof-of-work schemes are based on SHA-256 and scrypt.[18]\n Some other hashing algorithms that are used for proof-of-work include CryptoNote, Blake, SHA-3, and X11.\n Another method is called the proof-of-stake scheme. Proof-of-stake is a method of securing a cryptocurrency network and achieving distributed consensus through requesting users to show ownership of a certain amount of currency. It is different from proof-of-work systems that run difficult hashing algorithms to validate electronic transactions. The scheme is largely dependent on the coin, and there is currently no standard form of it. Some cryptocurrencies use a combined proof-of-work and proof-of-stake scheme.[18]\n On a blockchain, mining is the validation of transactions. For this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward. The reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network. The rate of generating hashes, which validate any transaction, has been increased by the use of specialized hardware such as FPGAs and ASICs running complex hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and scrypt.[65] This arms race for cheaper-yet-efficient machines has existed since bitcoin was introduced in 2009.[65] Mining is measured by hash rate, typically in TH/s.[66] A 2023 IMF working paper found that crypto mining could generate 450 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2027, accounting for 0.7 percent of global emissions, or 1.2 percent of the world total[67]\n With more people entering the world of virtual currency, generating hashes for validation has become more complex over time, forcing miners to invest increasingly large sums of money to improve computing performance. Consequently, the reward for finding a hash has diminished and often does not justify the investment in equipment and cooling facilities (to mitigate the heat the equipment produces) and the electricity required to run them.[68] Popular regions for mining include those with inexpensive electricity, a cold climate, and jurisdictions with clear and conducive regulations. By July 2019, bitcoin's electricity consumption was estimated to be approximately 7 gigawatts, around 0.2% of the global total, or equivalent to the energy consumed nationally by Switzerland.[69]\n Some miners pool resources, sharing their processing power over a network to split the reward equally, according to the amount of work they contributed to the probability of finding a block. A \"share\" is awarded to members of the mining pool who present a valid partial proof-of-work.\n As of February 2018[update], the Chinese government has halted trading of virtual currency, banned initial coin offerings, and shut down mining. Many Chinese miners have since relocated to Canada[70] and Texas.[71] One company is operating data centers for mining operations at Canadian oil and gas field sites due to low gas prices.[72] In June 2018, Hydro Quebec proposed to the provincial government to allocate 500 megawatts of power to crypto companies for mining.[73] According to a February 2018 report from Fortune, Iceland has become a haven for cryptocurrency miners in part because of its cheap electricity.[74]\n In March 2018, the city of Plattsburgh, New York put an 18-month moratorium on all cryptocurrency mining in an effort to preserve natural resources and the \"character and direction\" of the city.[75] In 2021, Kazakhstan became the second-biggest crypto-currency mining country, producing 18.1% of the global exahash rate. The country built a compound containing 50,000 computers near Ekibastuz.[76]\n An increase in cryptocurrency mining increased the demand for graphics cards (GPU) in 2017.[77] The computing power of GPUs makes them well-suited to generating hashes. Popular favorites of cryptocurrency miners, such as Nvidia's GTX 1060 and GTX 1070 graphics cards, as well as AMD's RX 570 and RX 580 GPUs, doubled or tripled in price – or were out of stock.[78] A GTX 1070 Ti, which was released at a price of $450, sold for as much as $1,100. Another popular card, the GTX 1060 (6 GB model), was released at an MSRP of $250 and sold for almost $500. RX 570 and RX 580 cards from AMD were out of stock for almost a year. Miners regularly buy up the entire stock of new GPUs as soon as they are available.[79]\n Nvidia has asked retailers to do what they can when it comes to selling GPUs to gamers instead of miners. Boris Böhles, PR manager for Nvidia in the German region, said: \"Gamers come first for Nvidia.\"[80]\n Numerous companies developed dedicated crypto-mining accelerator chips, capable of price-performance far higher than that of CPU or GPU mining. At one point, Intel marketed its own brand of crypto accelerator chip, named Blockscale.[81]\n A cryptocurrency wallet is a means of storing the public and private \"keys\" (address) or seed, which can be used to receive or spend the cryptocurrency.[82] With the private key, it is possible to write in the public ledger, effectively spending the associated cryptocurrency. With the public key, it is possible for others to send currency to the wallet.\n There exist multiple methods of storing keys or seed in a wallet. These methods range from using paper wallets (which are public, private, or seed keys written on paper), to using hardware wallets (which are hardware to store your wallet information), to a digital wallet (which is a computer with software hosting your wallet information), to hosting your wallet using an exchange where cryptocurrency is traded, or by storing your wallet information on a digital medium such as plaintext.[83]\n Bitcoin is pseudonymous, rather than anonymous; the cryptocurrency in a wallet is not tied to a person but rather to one or more specific keys (or \"addresses\").[84] Thereby, bitcoin owners are not immediately identifiable, but all transactions are publicly available in the blockchain.[85] Still, cryptocurrency exchanges are often required by law to collect the personal information of their users.[86]\n Some cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, Zerocoin, Zerocash, and CryptoNote, implement additional measures to increase privacy, such as by using zero-knowledge proofs.[87][88]\n A recent 2020 study presented different attacks on privacy in cryptocurrencies. The attacks demonstrated how the anonymity techniques are not sufficient safeguards. In order to improve privacy, researchers suggested several different ideas, including new cryptographic schemes and mechanisms for hiding the IP address of the source.[89]\n Cryptocurrencies are used primarily outside banking and governmental institutions and are exchanged over the Internet.\n Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, offer block rewards incentives for miners. There has been an implicit belief that whether miners are paid by block rewards or transaction fees does not affect the security of the blockchain, but a study suggests that this may not be the case under certain circumstances.[90]\n The rewards paid to miners increase the supply of the cryptocurrency. By making sure that verifying transactions is a costly business, the integrity of the network can be preserved as long as benevolent nodes control a majority of computing power. The verification algorithm requires a lot of processing power, and thus electricity, in order to make verification costly enough to accurately validate the public blockchain. Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, they must further consider the significant amount of electrical power in search of the solution. Generally, the block rewards outweigh electricity and equipment costs, but this may not always be the case.[91]\n The current value, not the long-term value, of the cryptocurrency supports the reward scheme to incentivize miners to engage in costly mining activities.[92] In 2018, bitcoin's design caused a 1.4% welfare loss compared to an efficient cash system, while a cash system with 2% money growth has a minor 0.003% welfare cost. The main source for this inefficiency is the large mining cost, which is estimated to be US$360 million per year. This translates into users being willing to accept a cash system with an inflation rate of 230% before being better off using bitcoin as a means of payment. However, the efficiency of the bitcoin system can be significantly improved by optimizing the rate of coin creation and minimizing transaction fees. Another potential improvement is to eliminate inefficient mining activities by changing the consensus protocol altogether.[93]\n Transaction fees (sometimes also referred to as miner fees or gas fees) for cryptocurrency depend mainly on the supply of network capacity at the time, versus the demand from the currency holder for a faster transaction.[94] The ability for the holder to be allowed to set the fee manually often depends on the wallet software used, and central exchanges for cryptocurrency (CEX) usually do not allow the customer to set a custom transaction fee for the transaction.[citation needed] Their wallet software, such as Coinbase Wallet, however, might support adjusting the fee.[95]\n Select cryptocurrency exchanges have offered to let the user choose between different presets of transaction fee values during the currency conversion. One of those exchanges, namely LiteBit, previously headquartered in the Netherlands, was forced to cease all operations on August 13th, 2023, \"due to market changes and regulatory pressure\".[96]\n The \"recommended fee\" suggested by the network will often depend on the time of day (due to depending on network load).\n For Ethereum, transaction fees differ by computational complexity, bandwidth use, and storage needs, while bitcoin transaction fees differ by transaction size and whether the transaction uses SegWit. In February 2023, the median transaction fee for Ether corresponded to $2.2845,[97] while for bitcoin it corresponded to $0.659.[98]\n Some cryptocurrencies have no transaction fees, the most well-known example being Nano (XNO), and instead rely on client-side proof-of-work as the transaction prioritization and anti-spam mechanism.[99][100][101]\n Cryptocurrency exchanges allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies[102] for other assets, such as conventional fiat money, or to trade between different digital currencies.\n Crypto marketplaces do not guarantee that an investor is completing a purchase or trade at the optimal price. As a result, as of 2020, it was possible to arbitrage to find the difference in price across several markets.[103]\n Atomic swaps are a mechanism where one cryptocurrency can be exchanged directly for another cryptocurrency without the need for a trusted third party, such as an exchange.[104]\n Jordan Kelley, founder of Robocoin, launched the first bitcoin ATM in the United States on 20 February 2014. The kiosk installed in Austin, Texas, is similar to bank ATMs but has scanners to read government-issued identification such as a driver's license or a passport to confirm users' identities.[105]\n An initial coin offering (ICO) is a controversial means of raising funds for a new cryptocurrency venture. An ICO may be used by startups with the intention of avoiding regulation. However, securities regulators in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S. and Canada, have indicated that if a coin or token is an \"investment contract\" (e.g., under the Howey test, i.e., an investment of money with a reasonable expectation of profit based significantly on the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others), it is a security and is subject to securities regulation. In an ICO campaign, a percentage of the cryptocurrency (usually in the form of \"tokens\") is sold to early backers of the project in exchange for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies, often bitcoin or Ether.[106][107][108]\n According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, four of the 10 biggest proposed initial coin offerings have used Switzerland as a base, where they are frequently registered as non-profit foundations. The Swiss regulatory agency FINMA stated that it would take a \"balanced approach\" to ICO projects and would allow \"legitimate innovators to navigate the regulatory landscape and so launch their projects in a way consistent with national laws protecting investors and the integrity of the financial system.\" In response to numerous requests by industry representatives, a legislative ICO working group began to issue legal guidelines in 2018, which are intended to remove uncertainty from cryptocurrency offerings and to establish sustainable business practices.[109]\n The market capitalization of a cryptocurrency is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins in circulation. The total cryptocurrency market cap has historically been dominated by bitcoin accounting for at least 50% of the market cap value where altcoins have increased and decreased in market cap value in relation to bitcoin. Bitcoin's value is largely determined by speculation among other technological limiting factors known as blockchain rewards coded into the architecture technology of bitcoin itself. The cryptocurrency market cap follows a trend known as the \"halving\", which is when the block rewards received from bitcoin are halved due to technological mandated limited factors instilled into bitcoin which in turn limits the supply of bitcoin. As the date reaches near of a halving (twice thus far historically) the cryptocurrency market cap increases, followed by a downtrend.[110]\n By June 2021, cryptocurrency had begun to be offered by some wealth managers in the US for 401(k)s.[111][112][113]\n Cryptocurrency prices are much more volatile than established financial assets such as stocks. For example, over one week in May 2022, bitcoin lost 20% of its value and Ethereum lost 26%, while Solana and Cardano lost 41% and 35% respectively. The falls were attributed to warnings about inflation. By comparison, in the same week, the Nasdaq tech stock index fell 7.6 per cent and the FTSE 100 was 3.6 per cent down.[114]\n In the longer term, of the 10 leading cryptocurrencies identified by the total value of coins in circulation in January 2018, only four (bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano and Ripple (XRP)) were still in that position in early 2022.[115] The total value of all cryptocurrencies was  $2 trillion at the end of 2021, but had halved nine months later.[116][117] The Wall Street Journal has commented that the crypto sector has become \"intertwined\" with the rest of the capital markets and \"sensitive to the same forces that drive tech stocks and other risk assets,\" such as inflation forecasts.[118]\n There are also centralized databases, outside of blockchains, that store crypto market data. Compared to the blockchain, databases perform fast as there is no verification process. Four of the most popular cryptocurrency market databases are CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, BraveNewCoin, and Cryptocompare.[119]\n According to Alan Feuer of The New York Times, libertarians and anarcho-capitalists were attracted to the philosophical idea behind bitcoin. Early bitcoin supporter Roger Ver said: \"At first, almost everyone who got involved did so for philosophical reasons. We saw bitcoin as a great idea, as a way to separate money from the state.\"[120] Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are \"something of a cult\" based in \"paranoid fantasies\" of government power.[121]\n David Golumbia says that the ideas influencing bitcoin advocates emerge from right-wing extremist movements such as the Liberty Lobby and the John Birch Society and their anti-Central Bank rhetoric, or, more recently, Ron Paul and Tea Party-style libertarianism.[122] Steve Bannon, who owns a \"good stake\" in bitcoin, sees cryptocurrency as a form of disruptive populism, taking control back from central authorities.[123]\n Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, supported the idea that cryptocurrencies go well with libertarianism. \"It's very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly,\" Nakamoto said in 2008.[124]\n According to the European Central Bank, the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the Austrian school of economics, especially with Friedrich von Hayek in his book Denationalisation of Money: The Argument Refined,[125] in which Hayek advocates a complete free market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks.[126]\n The rise in the popularity of cryptocurrencies and their adoption by financial institutions has led some governments to assess whether regulation is needed to protect users. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has defined cryptocurrency-related services as \"virtual asset service providers\" (VASPs) and recommended that they be regulated with the same money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements as financial institutions.[127]\n In May 2020, the Joint Working Group on interVASP Messaging Standards published \"IVMS 101\", a universal common language for communication of required originator and beneficiary information between VASPs. The FATF and financial regulators were informed as the data model was developed.[128]\n In June 2020, FATF updated its guidance to include the \"Travel Rule\" for cryptocurrencies, a measure which mandates that VASPs obtain, hold, and exchange information about the originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transfers.[129] Subsequent standardized protocol specifications recommended using JSON for relaying data between VASPs and identity services. As of December 2020, the IVMS 101 data model has yet to be finalized and ratified by the three global standard setting bodies that created it.[130]\n The European Commission published a digital finance strategy in September 2020. This included a draft regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA), which aimed to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets in the EU.[131][132]\n On 10 June 2021, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision proposed that banks that held cryptocurrency assets must set aside capital to cover all potential losses. For instance, if a bank were to hold bitcoin worth $2 billion, it would be required to set aside enough capital to cover the entire $2 billion. This is a more extreme standard than banks are usually held to when it comes to other assets. However, this is a proposal and not a regulation.\n The IMF is seeking a coordinated, consistent and comprehensive approach to supervising cryptocurrencies. Tobias Adrian, the IMF's financial counsellor and head of its monetary and capital markets department said in a January 2022 interview that \"Agreeing global regulations is never quick. But if we start now, we can achieve the goal of maintaining financial stability while also enjoying the benefits which the underlying technological innovations bring,\"[133]\n In May 2024, 15 years after the advent of the first blockchain, bitcoin, the US Congress advanced a bill to the full House of Representatives to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act, which defines responsibilities between various US agencies, notably between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for decentralized blockchains and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for blockchains that are functional but not decentralized.  Stablecoins are excluded from both CFTC and SEC regulation in this bill, \"except for fraud and certain activities by registered firms.\"[134]\n In September 2017, China banned ICOs to cause abnormal return from cryptocurrency decreasing during announcement window. The liquidity changes by banning ICOs in China was temporarily negative while the liquidity effect became positive after news.[135]\n On 18 May 2021, China banned financial institutions and payment companies from being able to provide cryptocurrency transaction related services.[136] This led to a sharp fall in the price of the biggest proof of work cryptocurrencies. For instance, bitcoin fell 31%, Ethereum fell 44%, Binance Coin fell 32% and Dogecoin fell 30%.[137] Proof of work mining was the next focus, with regulators in popular mining regions citing the use of electricity generated from highly polluting sources such as coal to create bitcoin and Ethereum.[138]\n In September 2021, the Chinese government declared all cryptocurrency transactions of any kind illegal, completing its crackdown on cryptocurrency.[26]\n In April 2024, TVNZ's 1News reported that the Cook Islands government was proposing legislation that would allow \"recovery agents\" to use various means including hacking to investigate or find cryptocurrency that may have been used for illegal means or is the \"proceeds of crime.\" The Tainted Cryptocurrency Recovery Bill was drafted by two lawyers hired by US-based debt collection company Drumcliffe. The proposed legislation was criticised by Cook Islands Crown Law's deputy solicitor general David Greig, who described it as \"flawed\" and said that some provisions were \"clearly unconstitutional\". The Cook Islands Financial Services Development Authority described Drumcliffe's involvement as a conflict of interest.[139]\n Similar criticism was echoed by Auckland University of Technology cryptocurrency specialist and senior lecturer Jeff Nijsse and University of Otago political scientist Professor Robert Patman, who described it as government overreach and described it as inconsistent with international law. Since the Cook Islands is an associated state that is part of the Realm of New Zealand, Patman said that the law would have \"implications for New Zealand's governance arrangements.\" A spokesperson for New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters confirmed that New Zealand officials were discussing the legislation with their Cook Islands counterparts.  Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown defended the legislation as part of the territory's fight against international cybercrime.[139]\n On 9 June 2021, El Salvador announced that it will adopt bitcoin as legal tender, becoming the first country to do so.[140]\n At present, India neither prohibits nor allows investment in the cryptocurrency market. In 2020, the Supreme Court of India had lifted the ban on cryptocurrency, which was imposed by the Reserve Bank of India.[141][142][143][144] Since then, an investment in cryptocurrency is considered legitimate, though there is still ambiguity about the issues regarding the extent and payment of tax on the income accrued thereupon and also its regulatory regime. But it is being contemplated that the Indian Parliament will soon pass a specific law to either ban or regulate the cryptocurrency market in India.[145] Expressing his public policy opinion on the Indian cryptocurrency market to a well-known online publication, a leading public policy lawyer and Vice President of SAARCLAW (South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation in Law) Hemant Batra has said that the \"cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment\".[146] He mooted regulating the cryptocurrency market rather than completely banning it. He favoured following IMF and FATF guidelines in this regard.\n South Africa, which has seen a large number of scams related to cryptocurrency, is said to be putting a regulatory timeline in place that will produce a regulatory framework.[147] The largest scam occurred in April 2021, where the two founders of an African-based cryptocurrency exchange called Africrypt, Raees Cajee and Ameer Cajee, disappeared with $3.8 billion worth of bitcoin.[148] Additionally, Mirror Trading International disappeared with $170 million worth of cryptocurrency in January 2021.[148]\n In March 2021, South Korea implemented new legislation to strengthen their oversight of digital assets. This legislation requires all digital asset managers, providers and exchanges to be registered with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit in order to operate in South Korea.[149] Registering with this unit requires that all exchanges are certified by the Information Security Management System and that they ensure all customers have real name bank accounts. It also requires that the CEO and board members of the exchanges have not been convicted of any crimes and that the exchange holds sufficient levels of deposit insurance to cover losses arising from hacks.[149]\n Switzerland was one of the first countries to implement the FATF's Travel Rule. FINMA, the Swiss regulator, issued its own guidance to VASPs in 2019. The guidance followed the FATF's Recommendation 16, however with stricter requirements. According to FINMA's[150] requirements, VASPs need to verify the identity of the beneficiary of the transfer.\n On 30 April 2021, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey banned the use of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets for making purchases on the grounds that the use of cryptocurrencies for such payments poses significant transaction risks.[151]\n In the United Kingdom, as of 10 January 2021, all cryptocurrency firms, such as exchanges, advisors and professionals that have either a presence, market product or provide services within the UK market must register with the Financial Conduct Authority. Additionally, on 27 June 2021, the financial watchdog demanded that Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange,[152] cease all regulated activities in the UK.[153]\n In 2021, 17 states in the US passed laws and resolutions concerning cryptocurrency regulation.[154] This led the Securities and Exchange Commission to start considering what steps to take. On 8 July 2021, Senator Elizabeth Warren, part of the Senate Banking Committee, wrote to the chairman of the SEC and demanded answers on cryptocurrency regulation due to the increase in cryptocurrency exchange use and the danger this posed to consumers. On 5 August 2021, the chairman, Gary Gensler, responded to Warren's letter and called for legislation focused on \"crypto trading, lending and DeFi platforms,\" because of how vulnerable investors could be when they traded on crypto trading platforms without a broker. He also argued that many tokens in the crypto market may be unregistered securities without required disclosures or market oversight. Additionally, Gensler did not hold back in his criticism of stablecoins. These tokens, which are pegged to the value of fiat currencies, may allow individuals to bypass important public policy goals related to traditional banking and financial systems, such as anti-money laundering, tax compliance, and sanctions.[155]\n On 19 October 2021, the first bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) from ProShares started trading on the NYSE under the ticker \"BITO.\" ProShares CEO Michael L. Sapir said the ETF would expose bitcoin to a wider range of investors without the hassle of setting up accounts with cryptocurrency providers. Ian Balina, the CEO of Token Metrics, stated that SEC approval of the ETF was a significant endorsement for the crypto industry because many regulators globally were not in favor of crypto, and retail investors were hesitant to accept crypto. This event would eventually open more opportunities for new capital and new people in this space.[156]\n The Department of the Treasury, on 20 May 2021, announced that it would require any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service since cryptocurrency already posed a problem where illegal activity like tax evasion was facilitated broadly. This release from the IRS was a part of efforts to promote better compliance and consider more severe penalties for tax evaders.[157]\n On 17 February 2022, the Department of Justice named Eun Young Choi as the first director of a National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to help identify and deal with misuse of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets.[158]\n The Biden administration faced a dilemma as it tried to develop regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. On one hand, officials were hesitant to restrict a growing industry. On the other hand, they were committed to preventing illegal cryptocurrency transactions. To reconcile these conflicting goals, on 9 March 2022, Biden issued an executive order.[159] Followed this, on 16 September 2022, the Comprehensive Framework for Responsible Development of Digital Assets document was released[160] to support development of cryptocurrencies and restrict their illegal use. The executive order included all digital assets, but cryptocurrencies posed both the greatest security risks and potential economic benefits. Though this might not address all of the challenges in crypto industry, it was a significant milestone in the US cryptocurrency regulation history.[161]\n In February 2023, the SEC ruled that cryptocurrency exchange Kraken's estimated $42 billion in staked assets globally operated as an illegal securities seller. The company agreed to a $30 million settlement with the SEC and to cease selling its staking service in the US. The case would impact other major crypto exchanges operating staking programs.[162]\n On 23 March 2023, the SEC issued an alert to investors stating that firms offering crypto asset securities might not be complying with US laws. The SEC argued that unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities might not include important information.[163]\n The legal status of cryptocurrencies varies substantially from country to country and is still undefined or changing in many of them. At least one study has shown that broad generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated and that blockchain analysis is an effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.[164] While some countries have explicitly allowed their use and trade,[165] others have banned or restricted it. According to the Library of Congress in 2021,\nan \"absolute ban\" on trading or using cryptocurrencies applies in 9 countries:\nAlgeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, and the United Arab Emirates. An \"implicit ban\" applies in another 39 countries or regions, which include: Bahrain, Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Gabon, Georgia, Guyana, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lesotho, Macau, Maldives, Mali, Moldova, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Republic of Congo, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Togo, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Qatar and Vietnam.[166] In the United States and Canada, state and provincial securities regulators, coordinated through the North American Securities Administrators Association, are investigating \"Bitcoin scams\" and ICOs in 40 jurisdictions.[167]\n Various government agencies, departments, and courts have classified bitcoin differently. China Central Bank banned the handling of bitcoins by financial institutions in China in early 2014.\n In Russia, though owning cryptocurrency is legal, its residents are only allowed to purchase goods from other residents using the Russian ruble while nonresidents are allowed to use foreign currency.[168] Regulations and bans that apply to bitcoin probably extend to similar cryptocurrency systems.[169]\n In August 2018, the Bank of Thailand announced its plans to create its own cryptocurrency, the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).[170]\n With the pro-crypto administration and vision under the new President of the United States, Donald Trump, the U.S. Congress is expected to prioritize cryptocurrency legislation in 2025, with a focus on the Stablecoin Act and the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century (FIT21) Act. This legislative push is anticipated to be the most supportive of the crypto industry to date. Key issues include the Stablecoin Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The FIT21 Act, focusing on decentralized standards and broader crypto regulation. Tax issues, including potential adjustments to staking reward tax rules. The legislation is expected to provide regulatory clarity for agencies overseeing digital asset markets and integrate digital assets into existing tax and banking laws. A Wyoming senator has proposed establishing a national Bitcoin reserve, though this lacks broad support. This legislative focus aligns with the growing institutional involvement in crypto through ETF investments, tokenized treasuries, and stablecoin initiatives. The regulatory clarity is anticipated to come primarily from Congress rather than the SEC.\n Cryptocurrency advertisements have been banned on the following platforms:\n On 25 March 2014, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ruled that bitcoin will be treated as property for tax purposes. Therefore, virtual currencies are considered commodities subject to capital gains tax.[178]\n As the popularity and demand for online currencies has increased since the inception of bitcoin in 2009,[179] so have concerns that such an unregulated person to person global economy that cryptocurrencies offer may become a threat to society. Concerns abound that altcoins may become tools for anonymous web criminals.[180]\n Cryptocurrency networks display a lack of regulation that has been criticized as enabling criminals who seek to evade taxes and launder money. Money laundering issues are also present in regular bank transfers, however with bank-to-bank wire transfers for instance, the account holder must at least provide a proven identity.\n Transactions that occur through the use and exchange of these altcoins are independent from formal banking systems, and therefore can make tax evasion simpler for individuals. Since charting taxable income is based upon what a recipient reports to the revenue service, it becomes extremely difficult to account for transactions made using existing cryptocurrencies, a mode of exchange that is complex and difficult to track.[180]\n Systems of anonymity that most cryptocurrencies offer can also serve as a simpler means to launder money. Rather than laundering money through an intricate net of financial actors and offshore bank accounts, laundering money through altcoins can be achieved through anonymous transactions.[180]\n Cryptocurrency makes legal enforcement against extremist groups more complicated, which consequently strengthens them.[181] White supremacist Richard Spencer went as far as to declare bitcoin the \"currency of the alt-right\".[182]\n In February 2014, the world's largest bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox, declared bankruptcy. Likely due to theft, the company claimed that it had lost nearly 750,000 bitcoins belonging to their clients. This added up to approximately 7% of all bitcoins in existence, worth a total of $473 million. Mt. Gox blamed hackers, who had exploited the transaction malleability problems in the network. The price of a bitcoin fell from a high of about $1,160 in December to under $400 in February.[183]\n On 21 November 2017, Tether announced that it had been hacked, losing $31 million in USDT from its core treasury wallet.[184]\n On 7 December 2017, Slovenian cryptocurrency exchange Nicehash reported that hackers had stolen over $70 million using a hijacked company computer.[185]\n On 19 December 2017, Yapian, the owner of South Korean exchange Youbit, filed for bankruptcy after suffering two hacks that year.[186][187] Customers were still granted access to 75% of their assets.\n In May 2018, Bitcoin Gold had its transactions hijacked and abused by unknown hackers.[188] Exchanges lost an estimated $18m and bitcoin Gold was delisted from Bittrex after it refused to pay its share of the damages.\n On 13 September 2018, Homero Josh Garza was sentenced to 21 months of imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release.[189] Garza had founded the cryptocurrency startups GAW Miners and ZenMiner in 2014, acknowledged in a plea agreement that the companies were part of a pyramid scheme, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud in 2015. The SEC separately brought a civil enforcement action in the US against Garza, who was eventually ordered to pay a judgment of $9.1 million plus $700,000 in interest. The SEC's complaint stated that Garza, through his companies, had fraudulently sold \"investment contracts representing shares in the profits they claimed would be generated\" from mining.[190]\n In January 2018, Japanese exchange Coincheck reported that hackers had stolen cryptocurrency worth $530 million.[191]\n In June 2018, South Korean exchange Coinrail was hacked, losing over $37 million in crypto.[192] The hack worsened a cryptocurrency selloff by an additional $42 billion.[193]\n On 9 July 2018, the exchange Bancor, whose code and fundraising had been subjects of controversy, had $23.5 million in crypto stolen.[194]\n A 2020 EU report found that users had lost crypto-assets worth hundreds of millions of US dollars in security breaches at exchanges and storage providers. Between 2011 and 2019, reported breaches ranged from four to twelve a year. In 2019, more than a billion dollars worth of cryptoassets was reported stolen. Stolen assets \"typically find their way to illegal markets and are used to fund further criminal activity\".[195]\n According to a 2020 report produced by the United States Attorney General's Cyber-Digital Task Force, hree categories make up the majority of illicit cryptocurrency uses: \"(1) financial transactions associated with the commission of crimes; (2) money laundering and the shielding of legitimate activity from tax, reporting, or other legal requirements; or (3) crimes, such as theft, directly implicating the cryptocurrency marketplace itself.\" The report concluded that \"for cryptocurrency to realize its truly transformative potential, it is imperative that these risks be addressed\" and that \"the government has legal and regulatory tools available at its disposal to confront the threats posed by cryptocurrency's illicit uses\".[196][197]\n According to the UK 2020 national risk assessment—a comprehensive assessment of money laundering and terrorist financing risk in the UK—the risk of using cryptoassets such as bitcoin for money laundering and terrorism financing is assessed as \"medium\" (from \"low\" in the previous 2017 report).[198] Legal scholars suggested that the money laundering opportunities may be more perceived than real.[199] Blockchain analysis company Chainalysis concluded that illicit activities like cybercrime, money laundering and terrorism financing made up only 0.15% of all crypto transactions conducted in 2021, representing a total of $14 billion.[200][201][202]\n In December 2021, Monkey Kingdom, a NFT project based in Hong Kong, lost US$1.3 million worth of cryptocurrencies via a phishing link used by the hacker.[203]\n On November 2, 2023, Sam Bankman-Fried was pronounced guilty on seven counts of fraud related to FTX.[204] Federal criminal court sentencing experts speculated on the potential amount of prison time likely to be meted out.[205][206][207] On March 28, 2024, the court sentenced Bankman-Fried to 25 years in prison.[208]\n According to blockchain data company Chainalysis, criminals laundered US$8,600,000,000 worth of cryptocurrency in 2021, up by 30% from the previous year.[209] The data suggests that rather than managing numerous illicit havens, cybercriminals make use of a small group of purpose built centralized exchanges for sending and receiving illicit cryptocurrency. In 2021, those exchanges received 47% of funds sent by crime linked addresses.[210] Almost $2.2bn worth of cryptocurrencies was embezzled from DeFi protocols in 2021, which represents 72% of all cryptocurrency theft in 2021.\n According to Bloomberg and the New York Times, Federation Tower, a two skyscraper complex in the heart of Moscow City, is home to many cryptocurrency businesses under suspicion of facilitating extensive money laundering, including accepting illicit cryptocurrency funds obtained through scams, darknet markets, and ransomware.[211] Notable businesses include Garantex,[212] Eggchange, Cashbank, Buy-Bitcoin, Tetchange, Bitzlato, and Suex, which was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2021. Bitzlato founder and owner Anatoly Legkodymov was arrested following money-laundering charges by the United States Department of Justice.[213]\n Dark money has also been flowing into Russia through a dark web marketplace called Hydra, which is powered by cryptocurrency, and enjoyed more than $1 billion in sales in 2020, according to Chainalysis.[214] The platform demands that sellers liquidate cryptocurrency only through certain regional exchanges, which has made it difficult for investigators to trace the money.\n Almost 74% of ransomware revenue in 2021 — over $400 million worth of cryptocurrency — went to software strains likely affiliated with Russia, where oversight is notoriously limited.[211] However, Russians are also leaders in the benign adoption of cryptocurrencies, as the ruble is unreliable, and President Putin favours the idea of \"overcoming the excessive domination of the limited number of reserve currencies.\"[215]\n In 2022, RenBridge - an unregulated alternative to exchanges for transferring value between blockchains - was found to be responsible for the laundering of at least $540 million since 2020. It is especially popular with people attempting to launder money from theft. This includes a cyberattack on Japanese crypto exchange Liquid that has been linked to North Korea.[216]\n Properties of cryptocurrencies gave them popularity in applications such as a safe haven in banking crises and means of payment, which also led to the cryptocurrency use in controversial settings in the form of online black markets, such as Silk Road.[180] The original Silk Road was shut down in October 2013 and there have been two more versions in use since then. In the year following the initial shutdown of Silk Road, the number of prominent dark markets increased from four to twelve, while the amount of drug listings increased from 18,000 to 32,000.[180]\n Darknet markets present challenges in regard to legality. Cryptocurrency used in dark markets are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world. In the US, bitcoins are regarded as \"virtual assets\".[citation needed] This type of ambiguous classification puts pressure on law enforcement agencies around the world to adapt to the shifting drug trade of dark markets.[217][unreliable source?]\n Various studies have found that crypto-trading is rife with wash trading. Wash trading is a process, illegal in some jurisdictions, involving buyers and sellers being the same person or group, and may be used to manipulate the price of a cryptocurrency or inflate volume artificially. Exchanges with higher volumes can demand higher premiums from token issuers.[218] A study from 2019 concluded that up to 80% of trades on unregulated cryptocurrency exchanges could be wash trades.[218] A 2019 report by Bitwise Asset Management claimed that 95% of all bitcoin trading volume reported on major website CoinMarketCap had been artificially generated, and of 81 exchanges studied, only 10 provided legitimate volume figures.[219]\n In 2022, cryptocurrencies attracted attention when Western nations imposed severe economic sanctions on Russia in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine in February. However, American sources warned in March that some crypto-transactions could potentially be used to evade economic sanctions against Russia and Belarus.[220]\n In April 2022, the computer programmer Virgil Griffith received a five-year prison sentence in the US for attending a Pyongyang cryptocurrency conference, where he gave a presentation on blockchains which might be used for sanctions evasion.[221]\n The Bank for International Settlements summarized several criticisms of cryptocurrencies in Chapter V of their 2018 annual report. The criticisms include the lack of stability in their price, the high energy consumption, high and variable transactions costs, the poor security and fraud at cryptocurrency exchanges, vulnerability to debasement (from forking), and the influence of miners.[222][223][224]\n Cryptocurrencies have been compared to Ponzi schemes, pyramid schemes[225] and economic bubbles,[226] such as housing market bubbles.[227] Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital Management stated in 2017 that digital currencies were \"nothing but an unfounded fad (or perhaps even a pyramid scheme), based on a willingness to ascribe value to something that has little or none beyond what people will pay for it\", and compared them to the tulip mania (1637), South Sea Bubble (1720), and dot-com bubble (1999), which all experienced profound price booms and busts.[228]\n Regulators in several countries have warned against cryptocurrency and some have taken measures to dissuade users.[229] However, research in 2021 by the UK's financial regulator suggests such warnings either went unheard, or were ignored. Fewer than one in 10 potential cryptocurrency buyers were aware of consumer warnings on the FCA website, and 12% of crypto users were not aware that their holdings were not protected by statutory compensation.[230][231] Of 1,000 respondents between the ages of eighteen and forty, almost 70% wrongly assumed cryptocurrencies were regulated, 75% of younger crypto investors claimed to be driven by competition with friends and family, 58% said that social media enticed them to make high risk investments.[232] The FCA recommends making use of its warning list, which flags unauthorized financial firms.[233]\n Many banks do not offer virtual currency services themselves and can refuse to do business with virtual currency companies.[234] In 2014, Gareth Murphy, a senior banking officer, suggested that the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies may lead to too much money being obfuscated, blinding economists who would use such information to better steer the economy.[235] While traditional financial products have strong consumer protections in place, there is no intermediary with the power to limit consumer losses if bitcoins are lost or stolen. One of the features cryptocurrency lacks in comparison to credit cards, for example, is consumer protection against fraud, such as chargebacks.\n The French regulator Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) lists 16 websites of companies that solicit investment in cryptocurrency without being authorized to do so in France.[236]\n An October 2021 paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that bitcoin suffers from systemic risk as the top 10,000 addresses control about one-third of all bitcoin in circulation.[237] It is even worse for miners, with 0.01% controlling 50% of the capacity. According to researcher Flipside Crypto, less than 2% of anonymous accounts control 95% of all available bitcoin supply.[238] This is considered risky as a great deal of the market is in the hands of a few entities.\n A paper by John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas, and Amin Shams, a graduate student found that in 2017 the price of bitcoin had been substantially inflated using another cryptocurrency, Tether.[239]\n Roger Lowenstein, author of \"Bank of America: The Epic Struggle to Create the Federal Reserve,\" says in a New York Times story that FTX will face over $8 billion in claims.[240]\n Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent art, collectibles, gaming, etc. Like crypto, their data is stored on the blockchain. NFTs are bought and traded using cryptocurrency. The Ethereum blockchain was the first place where NFTs were implemented, but now many other blockchains have created their own versions of NFTs.\n According to Vanessa Grellet, renowned panelist in blockchain conferences,[241] there was an increasing interest from traditional stock exchanges in crypto-assets at the end of the 2010s, while crypto-exchanges such as Coinbase were gradually entering the traditional financial markets. This convergence marked a significant trend where conventional financial actors were adopting blockchain technology to enhance operational efficiency, while the crypto world introduced innovations like Security Token Offering (STO), enabling new ways of fundraising. Tokenization, turning assets such as real estate, investment funds, and private equity into blockchain-based tokens, had the potential to make traditionally illiquid assets more accessible to investors. Despite the regulatory risks associated with such developments, major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, were actively working on blockchain initiatives, exemplified by the creation of Quorum, a private blockchain platform.[242]\n As the first big Wall Street bank to embrace cryptocurrencies, Morgan Stanley announced on 17 March 2021 that they will be offering access to bitcoin funds for their wealthy clients through three funds which enable bitcoin ownership for investors with an aggressive risk tolerance.[243] BNY Mellon on 11 February 2021 announced that it would begin offering cryptocurrency services to its clients.[244]\n On 20 April 2021,[245] Venmo added support to its platform to enable customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies.[246]\n In October 2021, financial services company Mastercard announced it is working with digital asset manager Bakkt on a platform that would allow any bank or merchant on the Mastercard network to offer cryptocurrency services.[247]\n Mining for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies requires enormous amounts of electricity and consequently comes with a large carbon footprint due to causing greenhouse gas emissions.[248] Proof-of-work blockchains such as bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero were estimated to have added between 3 million and 15 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere in the period from 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2017.[249] By November 2018, bitcoin was estimated to have an annual energy consumption of 45.8TWh, generating 22.0 to 22.9 million tons of CO2, rivalling nations like Jordan and Sri Lanka.[250] By the end of 2021, bitcoin was estimated to produce 65.4 million tons of CO2, as much as Greece,[251] and consume between 91 and 177 terawatt-hours annually.[252][253]\n Critics have also identified a large electronic waste problem in disposing of mining rigs.[254] Mining hardware is improving at a fast rate, quickly resulting in older generations of hardware.[255]\n Bitcoin is the least energy-efficient cryptocurrency, using 707.6 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.[256]\n Before June 2021, China was the primary location for bitcoin mining. However, due to concerns over power usage and other factors, China forced out bitcoin operations, at least temporarily. As a result, the United States promptly emerged as the top global leader in the industry. An example of a gross amount of electronic waste associated with bitcoin mining operations in the US is a facility that located in Dalton, Georgia which is consuming nearly the same amount of electricity as the combined power usage of 97,000 households in its vicinity. Another example is that Riot Platforms operates a bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas, which consumes approximately as much electricity as the nearby 300,000 households. This makes it the most energy-intensive bitcoin mining operation in the United States.[257]\n The world's second-largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum, uses 62.56 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.[258] XRP is the world's most energy efficient cryptocurrency, using 0.0079 kilowatt-hours of electricity per transaction.[259]\n Although the biggest PoW blockchains consume energy on the scale of medium-sized countries, the annual power demand from proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains is on a scale equivalent to a housing estate. The Times identified six \"environmentally friendly\" cryptocurrencies: Chia, IOTA, Cardano, Nano, Solarcoin and Bitgreen.[260] Academics and researchers have used various methods for estimating the energy use and energy efficiency of blockchains. A study of the six largest proof-of-stake networks in May 2021 concluded:\n In terms of annual consumption (kWh/yr), the figures were: Polkadot (70,237), Tezos (113,249), Avalanche (489,311), Algorand (512,671), Cardano (598,755) and Solana (1,967,930). This equates to Polkadot consuming 7 times the electricity of an average U.S. home, Cardano 57 homes and Solana 200 times as much. The research concluded that PoS networks consumed 0.001% the electricity of the bitcoin network.[261] University College London researchers reached a similar conclusion.[262]\n Variable renewable energy power stations could invest in bitcoin mining to reduce curtailment, hedge electricity price risk, stabilize the grid, increase the profitability of renewable energy power stations and therefore accelerate transition to sustainable energy.[263][264][265][266][267]\n There are also purely technical elements to consider. For example, technological advancement in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin result in high up-front costs to miners in the form of specialized hardware and software.[268] Cryptocurrency transactions are normally irreversible after a number of blocks confirm the transaction. Additionally, cryptocurrency private keys can be permanently lost from local storage due to malware, data loss or the destruction of the physical media. This precludes the cryptocurrency from being spent, resulting in its effective removal from the markets.[269]\n In September 2015, the establishment of the peer-reviewed academic journal Ledger (ISSN 2379-5980) was announced. It covers studies of cryptocurrencies and related technologies, and is published by the University of Pittsburgh.[270]\n The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which will then be timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address in the first page of their papers.[271][272]\n A number of aid agencies have started accepting donations in cryptocurrencies, including UNICEF.[273] Christopher Fabian, principal adviser at UNICEF Innovation, said the children's fund would uphold donor protocols, meaning that people making donations online would have to pass checks before they were allowed to deposit funds.[274][275]\n However, in 2021, there was a backlash against donations in bitcoin because of the environmental emissions it caused. Some agencies stopped accepting bitcoin and others turned to \"greener\" cryptocurrencies.[276] The U.S. arm of Greenpeace stopped accepting bitcoin donations after seven years. It said: \"As the amount of energy needed to run bitcoin became clearer, this policy became no longer tenable.\"[277]\n In 2022, the Ukrainian government raised over US$10,000,000 worth of aid through cryptocurrency following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[278]\n Bitcoin has been characterized as a speculative bubble by eight winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences: Paul Krugman,[279] Robert J. Shiller,[280] Joseph Stiglitz,[281] Richard Thaler,[282] James Heckman,[283] Thomas Sargent,[283] Angus Deaton,[283] and Oliver Hart;[283] and by central bank officials including Alan Greenspan,[284] Agustín Carstens,[285] Vítor Constâncio,[286] and Nout Wellink.[287]\n Investors Warren Buffett and George Soros have respectively characterized it as a \"mirage\"[288] and a \"bubble\";[289] while business executives Jack Ma and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon have called it a \"bubble\"[290] and a \"fraud\",[291] respectively, although Jamie Dimon later said he regretted dubbing bitcoin a fraud.[292] BlackRock CEO Laurence D. Fink called bitcoin an \"index of money laundering\".[293]\n In June 2022, business magnate Bill Gates said that cryptocurrencies are \"100% based on greater fool theory\".[294]\n Legal scholars criticize the lack of regulation, which hinders conflict resolution when crypto assets are at the center of a legal dispute, for example a divorce or an inheritance. In Switzerland, jurists generally deny that cryptocurrencies are objects that fall under property law, as cryptocurrencies do not belong to any class of legally defined objects (Typenzwang, the legal numerus clausus). Therefore, it is debated whether anybody could even be sued for embezzlement of cryptocurrency if he/she had access to someone's wallet. However, in the law of obligations and contract law, any kind of object would be legally valid, but the object would have to be tied to an identified counterparty. However, as the more popular cryptocurrencies can be freely and quickly exchanged into legal tender, they are financial assets and have to be taxed and accounted for as such.[295][296]\n In 2018, an increase in crypto-related suicides was noticed after the cryptocurrency market crashed in August. The situation was particularly critical in Korea as crypto traders were on \"suicide watch\". A cryptocurrency forum on Reddit even started providing suicide prevention support to affected investors.[297][298] The May 2022 collapse of the Luna currency operated by Terra also led to reports of suicidal investors in crypto-related subreddits.[299]\n",

        "title": "Energy industry",
        "content": "\n The energy industry is the totality of all of the industries involved in the production and sale of energy, including fuel extraction, manufacturing, refining and distribution. Modern society consumes large amounts of fuel, and the energy industry is a crucial part of the infrastructure and maintenance of society in almost all countries.\n In particular, the energy industry comprises:\n \nThe increased dependence during the 20th century on carbon-emitting energy sources, such as fossil fuels, and carbon-emitting renewables, such as biomass, means that the energy industry has frequently contributed to pollution and environmental impacts on the economy. Until recently, fossil fuels were the primary source of energy generation in most parts of the world and are a significant contributor to global warming and pollution. Many economies are investing in renewable and sustainable energy to limit global warming and reduce air pollution. The use of energy has been a key in the development of the human society by helping it to control and adapt to the environment. Managing the use of energy is inevitable in any functional society. In the industrialized world the development of energy resources has become essential for agriculture, transportation, waste collection, information technology, communications that have become prerequisites of a developed society. The increasing use of energy since the Industrial Revolution has also brought with it a number of serious problems, some of which, such as global warming, present potentially grave risks to the world.[1]\n In some industries, the word energy is used as a synonym for energy resources, which refer to substances like fuels, petroleum products, and electricity in general. This is because a significant portion of the energy contained in these resources can easily be extracted to serve a useful purpose. After a useful process has taken place, the total energy is conserved. Still, the resource itself is not conserved since a process usually transforms the energy into unusable forms (such as unnecessary or excess heat).\n Ever since humanity discovered various energy resources available in nature, it has been inventing devices, known as machines, that make life more comfortable by using energy resources. Thus, although primitive man knew the utility of fire to cook food, the invention of devices like gas burners and microwave ovens led to additional ways of how energy can be utilised. The trend is the same in any other field of social activity, be it the construction of social infrastructure, manufacturing of fabrics for covering, porting, printing, decorating, for example, textiles, air conditioning, communication of information, or for moving people and goods (automobiles).\n Production and consumption of energy resources is very important to the global economy.  All economic activity requires energy resources, whether to manufacture goods, provide transportation, run computers and other machines.\n Widespread demand for energy may encourage competing energy utilities and the formation of retail energy markets. Note the presence of the \"Energy Marketing and Customer Service\" (EMACS) sub-sector.[2]\n The energy sector accounts for 4.6% of outstanding leveraged loans, compared with 3.1% a decade ago, while energy bonds make up 15.7% of the $1.3 trillion junk bond market, up from 4.3% over the same period.[3]\n Since the cost of energy has become a significant factor in the performance of societies' economies, the management of energy resources has become crucial. Energy management involves utilizing the available energy resources more effectively, that is, with minimum incremental costs. Simple management techniques can often save energy expenditures without incorporating fresh technology.[4] Energy management is most often the practice of using energy more efficiently by eliminating energy wastage or balancing justifiable energy demand with appropriate energy supply. The process couples energy awareness with energy conservation.\n The United Nations developed the International Standard Industrial Classification, which is a list of economic and social classifications.[5] There is no distinct classification for an energy industry, because the classification system is based on activities, products, and expenditures according to purpose.[6]\n Countries in North America use the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The NAICS sectors #21 and #22 (mining and utilities) might roughly define the energy industry in North America. This classification is used by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n The Global Industry Classification Standard used by Morgan Stanley define the energy industry as comprising companies primarily working with oil, gas, coal and consumable fuels, excluding companies working with certain industrial gases.[7]\nAdd also to expand this section:  Dow Jones Industrial Average[8]\n Government encouragement in the form of subsidies and tax incentives for energy-conservation efforts has increasingly fostered the view of conservation as a major function of the energy industry: saving an amount of energy provides economic benefits almost identical to generating that same amount of energy. This is compounded by the fact that the economics of delivering energy tend to be priced for capacity as opposed to average usage. One of the purposes of a smart grid infrastructure is to smooth out demand so that capacity and demand curves align more closely.\nSome parts of the energy industry generate considerable pollution, including toxic and greenhouse gases from fuel combustion, nuclear waste from the generation of nuclear power, and oil spillages as a result of petroleum extraction. Government regulations to internalize these externalities form an increasing part of doing business, and the trading of carbon credits and pollution credits on the free market may also result in energy-saving and pollution-control measures becoming even more important to energy providers.\n Consumption of energy resources, (e.g. turning on a light) requires resources and has an effect on the environment. Many electric power plants burn coal, oil or natural gas in order to generate electricity for energy needs. While burning these fossil fuels produces a readily available and instantaneous supply of electricity, it also generates air pollutants including carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide and trioxide (SOx) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas, known to be responsible, along with methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases, for the rapid increase in global warming since the Industrial Revolution. In the 20th century, global temperature records are significantly higher than temperature records from thousands of years ago, taken from ice cores in Arctic regions. Burning fossil fuels for electricity generation also releases trace metals such as beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, mercury, nickel, and silver into the environment, which also act as pollutants.\n The large-scale use of renewable energy technologies would \"greatly mitigate or eliminate a wide range of environmental and human health impacts of energy use\".[9][10] Renewable energy technologies include biofuels, solar heating and cooling, hydroelectric power, solar power, and wind power.  Energy conservation and the efficient use of energy would also help.\n In addition, it is argued that there is also the potential to develop a more efficient energy sector. This can be done by:[11]\n Best available technology (BAT) offers supply-side efficiency levels far higher than global averages. The relative benefits of gas compared to coal are influenced by the development of increasingly efficient energy production methods. According to an impact assessment carried out for the European Commission, the levels of energy efficiency of coal-fired plants built have now increased to 46-49% efficiency rates, as compared to coals plants built before the 1990s (32-40%).[12] However, at the same time gas can reach 58-59% efficiency levels with the best available technology.[12] Meanwhile, combined heat and power can offer efficiency rates of 80-90%.[12]\n Since now energy plays an essential role in industrial societies, the ownership and control of energy resources plays an increasing role in politics. At the national level, governments seek to influence the sharing (distribution) of energy resources among various sections of the society through pricing mechanisms; or even who owns resources within their borders. They may also seek to influence the use of energy by individuals and business in an attempt to tackle environmental issues.\n The most recent international political controversy regarding energy resources is in the context of the Iraq Wars. Some political analysts maintain that the hidden reason for both 1991 and 2003 wars can be traced to strategic control of international energy resources.[13] Others counter this analysis with the numbers related to its economics. According to the latter group of analysts, U.S. has spent about $336 billion in Iraq[14] as compared with a background current value of $25 billion per year budget for the entire U.S. oil import dependence[15]\n Energy policy is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of energy development including energy production, distribution and consumption.  The attributes of energy policy may include legislation, international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for energy conservation, taxation and other public policy techniques.\n Energy security is the intersection of national security and the availability of natural resources for energy consumption. Access to cheap energy has become essential to the functioning of modern economies. However, the uneven distribution of energy supplies among countries has led to significant vulnerabilities. Threats to energy security include the political instability of several energy producing countries, the manipulation of energy supplies, the competition over energy sources, attacks on supply infrastructure, as well as accidents, natural disasters, the funding to foreign dictators, rising terrorism, and dominant countries reliance to the foreign oil supply.[16] The limited supplies, uneven distribution, and rising costs of fossil fuels, such as oil and gas, create a need to change to more sustainable energy sources in the foreseeable future. With as much dependence that the U.S. currently has for oil and with the peaking limits of oil production; economies and societies will begin to feel the decline in the resource that we have become dependent upon. Energy security has become one of the leading issues in the world today as oil and other resources have become as vital to the world's people. However, with oil production rates decreasing and oil production peak nearing, the world has come to protect what resources we have left. With new advancements in renewable resources, less pressure has been put on companies that produce the world's oil; these resources are geothermal, solar power, wind power, and hydroelectric. Although these are not all the current and possible options for the world to turn to as the oil depletes, the most critical issue is protecting these vital resources from future threats. These new resources will become more valuable as the price of exporting and importing oil will increase due to increased demand.\n Producing energy to sustain human needs is an essential social activity, and a great deal of effort goes into the activity. While most of such effort is limited towards increasing the production of electricity and oil, newer ways of producing usable energy resources from the available energy resources are being explored. One such effort is to explore means of producing hydrogen fuel from water. Though hydrogen use is environmentally friendly, its production requires energy and existing technologies to make it, are not very efficient. Research is underway to explore enzymatic decomposition of biomass.[17]\n Other forms of conventional energy resources are also being used in new ways. Coal gasification and liquefaction are recent technologies that are becoming attractive after the realization that oil reserves, at present consumption rates, may be rather short lived. See alternative fuels.\n Energy is the subject of significant research activities globally. For example, the UK Energy Research Centre is the focal point for UK energy research while the European Union has many technology programmes as well as a platform for engaging social science and humanities within energy research.[18]\n All societies require materials and food to be transported over distances, generally against some force of friction. Since application of force over distance requires the presence of a source of usable energy, such sources are of great worth in society.\n While energy resources are an essential ingredient for all modes of transportation in society, the transportation of energy resources is becoming equally important. Energy resources are frequently located far from the place where they are consumed. Therefore, their transportation is always in question. Some energy resources like liquid or gaseous fuels are transported using tankers or pipelines, while electricity transportation invariably requires a network of grid cables. The transportation of energy, whether by tanker, pipeline, or transmission line, poses challenges for scientists and engineers, policy makers, and economists to make it more risk-free and efficient.\n Economic and political instability can lead to an energy crisis. Notable oil crises are the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 oil crisis. The advent of peak oil, the point in time when the maximum rate of global petroleum extraction is reached, will likely precipitate another energy crisis.\n Between 1985 and 2018, there have been around 69,932 deals in the energy sector. This cumulates to an overall value of 9,578 bil USD. The most active year was 2010 with about 3.761 deals. In terms of value 2007 was the strongest year (684 bil. USD), which was followed by a steep decline until 2009 (-55,8%).[19]\n Here is a list of the top 10 deals in history in the energy sector:\n",

        "content": "\n The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (/sæks/ SAKS) is an American multinational investment bank and financial services company. Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is headquartered in Lower Manhattan in New York City, with regional headquarters in many international financial centers.[1] Goldman Sachs is the second-largest investment bank in the world by revenue[2] and is ranked 55th on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[3] In the Forbes Global 2000 of 2024, Goldman Sachs ranked 23rd.[4] It is considered a systemically important financial institution by the Financial Stability Board.\n Goldman Sachs offers services in investment banking (advisory for mergers and acquisitions and restructuring), securities underwriting, prime brokerage, asset management as well as wealth management and investment management via Goldman Sachs Personal Financial Management. It is a market maker for many types of financial products and provides clearing and custodian bank services. It operates private-equity funds and hedge funds. It structures complex and tailor-made financial products. It also owns Goldman Sachs Bank USA, a direct bank. It trades both on behalf of its clients (flow trading) and for its own account (proprietary trading). The company invests in and arranges financing for startups, and in many cases gets additional business as bookrunner when the companies launch initial public offerings.[5]\n In 1869, Goldman Sachs was founded by Marcus Goldman in New York City in a one-room basement office next to a coal chute.[6][7][8] In 1882, Goldman's son-in-law Samuel Sachs joined the firm.[9][10] In 1885, Goldman's son, Henry Goldman, and his son-in-law, Ludwig Dreyfuss, joined the business and the firm adopted its present name, Goldman Sachs & Co.[11] The company pioneered the use of commercial paper for entrepreneurs and joined the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1896.[12] By 1898, the firm's capital stood at $1.6 million.[12] It opened offices in Boston and Chicago in 1900, San Francisco in 1918, and Philadelphia and St. Louis in 1920.[13]\n Goldman entered the initial public offering market in 1906 when it took Sears, Roebuck and Company public.[12] The deal was facilitated by Henry Goldman's personal friendship with Julius Rosenwald, an owner of Sears.[12] Other underwriting work for initial public offerings followed, including those of General Cigar Company also in 1906, F. W. Woolworth Company in 1912, and Continental Can.[13][12] The firm was an innovator at establishing the price–earnings ratio, instead of book value, as a method for valuing companies, and was therefore able to raise funds for retailers and companies with few hard assets.[13]\n In 1912, Henry S. Bowers became the first non-member of the founding family to become a partner of the company and share in its profits.[12] In 1917, under growing pressure from the other partners in the firm due to his pro-German stance, Henry Goldman resigned.[12] The Sachs family gained full control of the firm until Waddill Catchings joined the company in 1918.[12] By 1928, Catchings was the Goldman partner with the single largest stake in the firm.[12] In 1919, the company acquired a major interest in Merck & Co. and in 1922, it acquired a major interest in General Foods.[13] On December 4, 1928, the firm launched the Goldman Sachs Trading Corp.Ad, a closed-end fund.[14] The fund failed during the Wall Street Crash of 1929, amid accusations that Goldman had engaged in share price manipulation and insider trading.[12]\n In 1930, during the Great Depression, the firm ousted Catchings, and Sidney Weinberg assumed the role of senior partner. Weinberg shifted Goldman's focus away from trading and toward investment banking.[12] His actions helped to restore some of Goldman's tarnished reputation. Under Weinberg's leadership, Goldman was the lead advisor on the $657 million initial public offering of Ford Motor Company in 1956, a major victory at the time, as well as the $350 million debenture offering by Sears Roebuck in 1958.[13] Under Weinberg's leadership, the firm started an investment research division and a municipal bond department, and it became an early innovator in risk arbitrage.[12]\n In the 1950s, Gus Levy joined the firm as a securities trader, where two powers fought for supremacy, one from investment banking and one from securities trading. Levy was a pioneer in block trading and the firm established this trend under his guidance. Due to Weinberg's heavy influence, the firm formed an investment banking division in 1956 in an attempt to shift focus off Weinberg.[12] In 1957, the company's headquarters were relocated to 20 Broad Street, New York City.[12]\n In 1969, Levy took over Weinberg's role as Senior Partner and built Goldman's trading franchise once again.[15] Levy is credited with Goldman's famous philosophy of being \"long-term greedy,\" which implied that as long as money is made over the long term, short-term losses are bearable. At the same time, partners reinvested nearly all of their earnings in the firm.[16] Weinberg remained a senior partner of the firm and died in July of that year.[17]\n Another financial crisis for the firm occurred in 1970, when the Penn Central Transportation Company went bankrupt with over $80 million (~$484 million in 2023) in commercial paper outstanding, most of it issued through Goldman Sachs. The bankruptcy was large, and the resulting lawsuits, notably by the SEC, threatened the partnership capital, survival, and reputation of the firm.[18] It was this bankruptcy that resulted in credit ratings for every issuer of commercial paper today by several credit rating services.[19]\n Under the direction of Senior Partner Stanley R. Miller, the firm opened its first international office in London in 1970 and created a Private Wealth Management division along with a fixed income division in 1972.[13][20] It pioneered the \"white knight\" strategy in 1974 during its attempts to defend Electric Storage Battery against a hostile takeover bid from International Nickel and Goldman's rival, Morgan Stanley.[21] John Weinberg, the son of Sidney Weinberg, and John C. Whitehead assumed the roles of co-senior partners in 1976, once again emphasizing the co-leadership at the firm. One of their initiatives was the establishment of 14 business principles.[22]\n On November 16, 1981, the firm acquired J. Aron & Company, a commodities trading firm that merged with the Fixed Income division to become known as Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities.[23] J. Aron was involved in the coffee and gold markets, and the former CEO of Goldman, Lloyd Blankfein, joined the firm as a result of this merger.[24]\n In 1983, the firm moved into a newly constructed global headquarters at 85 Broad Street and occupied that building until it moved to its current headquarters in 2009.[25][26] In 1985, it underwrote the public offering of the real estate investment trust that owned Rockefeller Center, then the largest REIT offering in history.[27] In accordance with the beginning of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the firm also became involved in facilitating the global privatization movement by advising companies that were spinning off from their parent governments.[28]\n In 1986, the firm formed Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which manages the majority of its mutual funds and hedge funds.[29] In the same year, the firm also underwrote the IPO of Microsoft, advised General Electric on its acquisition of RCA,[29] and joined the London and Tokyo stock exchanges, where its mergers and acquisitions grew.[13] During the 1980s, the firm became the first bank to distribute its investment research electronically and created the first public offering of original issue deep-discount bond.[29] In 1988, it helped the State Bank of India obtain a credit rating and issue US$200 million in the US commercial paper market.[30]\n Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman assumed the co-senior partnership in 1990 and pledged to focus on globalization of the firm to strengthen the merger & acquisition and trading business lines.[31] In 1990, the firm introduced paperless trading to the New York Stock Exchange.[32] Rubin left the firm in 1992 to work in the Presidency of Bill Clinton.[13] In 1994, the company launched the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) and opened its first office in China in Beijing.[33] That same year, Jon Corzine became CEO, following the retirement of Friedman as general partner.[34]\n Rubin had drawn criticism in Congress for using a Treasury Department account under his personal control to distribute $20 billion to bail out Mexican bonds, of which Goldman was a key distributor.[35] On November 22, 1994, the Mexican Bolsa stock market admitted Goldman Sachs and one other firm to operate on that market.[36] In 1994, the Mexican peso crisis threatened to wipe out the value of Mexico's bonds held by Goldman Sachs.[37]\n In 1994, Goldman financed Rockefeller Center in a deal that allowed it to take an ownership interest[38] in 1996, and sold Rockefeller Center to Tishman Speyer in 2000.[39] In April 1996, Goldman was the lead underwriter of the initial public offering of Yahoo!.[40] In 1998, it was the co-lead manager of the ¥2 trillion (yen) NTT DoCoMo IPO.[41] In 1999, Goldman acquired Hull Trading Company for $531 million (~$913 million in 2023),[42][43] as part of its shift towards electronic trading.[44] After decades of debate among the partners, the company became a public company via an initial public offering in May 1999.[45] Goldman sold 12.6% of the company to the public, and after the IPO, 48.3% of the company was held by 221 former partners, 21.2% of the company was held by non-partner employees, and the remaining 17.9% was held by retired Goldman partners and two long-time investors, Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Assn, the investing arm of Kamehameha Schools.[46] The shares were priced at $53 each at listing. After the IPO, Henry Paulson became chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding Jon Corzine.[47]\n In September 2000, Goldman Sachs purchased Spear, Leeds, & Kellogg, one of the largest specialist firms on the New York Stock Exchange, for $6.3 billion (~$10.6 billion in 2023).[48]\n In January 2000, Goldman, along with Lehman Brothers, was the lead manager for the first internet bond offering for the World Bank.[49]\n In 2000, Goldman Sachs advised Jim and Janet Baker on the sale of Dragon NaturallySpeaking to Lernout & Hauspie of Belgium for $580 million in L&H stock. L&H later collapsed due to accounting fraud and its stock price declined significantly. The Bakers filed a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs, alleging negligence, intentional and negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty since Goldman did not uncover and warn Dragon or the Bakers of the accounting problems of the acquirer, L&H. Lawyers for Goldman said it was not Goldman's job to uncover the accounting fraud. On January 23, 2013, a federal jury rejected the Bakers' claims and found Goldman Sachs not liable to the Bakers, instead siding with Goldman in counterclaims.[50]\n In March 2003, the firm took a 45% stake in a joint venture with JBWere, the Australian investment bank.[49] In April 2003, Goldman acquired The Ayco Company L.P., a fee-based financial counseling service.[51] In October 2003, in its Global Economics Paper No. 99 (Dreaming With BRICs: The Path to 2050), researchers at Goldman Sachs led by Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley introduced the BRIC concept, identifying the developing countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China,  as rising economic powers.[52] In May 2006, Paulson left the firm to serve as United States Secretary of the Treasury, and Lloyd Blankfein was promoted to chairman and chief executive officer.[53] In January 2007, Goldman, along with CanWest Global Communications, acquired Alliance Atlantis, the company with the broadcast rights to the CSI franchise.[54]\n As a result of its involvement in securitization during the subprime mortgage crisis, Goldman Sachs suffered during the 2007–2008 financial crisis,[55][56] and it received a $10 billion investment from the United States Department of the Treasury as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a financial bailout created by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The investment was made in November 2008 and was repaid with interest in June 2009.[57][58]\n During the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, Goldman profited from the collapse in subprime mortgage bonds in summer 2007 by short-selling subprime mortgage-backed securities. Two Goldman traders, Michael Swenson and Josh Birnbaum, are credited with being responsible for the firm's large profits during the crisis.[59][60] The pair, members of Goldman's structured products group in New York City, made a profit of $4 billion by \"betting\" on a collapse in the subprime market and shorting mortgage-related securities. By summer 2007, they persuaded colleagues to see their point of view and convinced skeptical risk management executives.[61] The firm initially avoided large subprime write-downs and achieved a net profit due to significant losses on non-prime securitized loans being offset by gains on short mortgage positions. The firm's viability was called into question as the crisis intensified in September 2008.\n In October 2007, Goldman Sachs was criticized for packaging risky mortgages and selling them to the public as safe investments.[62]\n In 2007, former Goldman Sachs trader Matthew Marshall Taylor was fired after hiding an $8.3 billion unauthorized trade involving derivatives on the S&P 500 index by making \"multiple false entries\" into a Goldman trading system, with the objective of protecting his year-end bonus of $1.5 million. The trades cost the company $118 million. In 2013, Taylor plead guilty to charges and was sentenced to 9 months in prison and was ordered to repay the $118 million loss.[63]\n On September 21, 2008, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the last two major investment banks in the United States, both confirmed that they would become traditional bank holding companies.[64][65] The Federal Reserve's approval of their bid to become banks ended the business model of an independent securities firm, 75 years after Congress separated them from deposit-taking lenders, and capped weeks of chaos that sent Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy and led to the rushed sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America[66] On September 23, 2008, Berkshire Hathaway agreed to purchase $5 billion in Goldman's preferred stock, and also received warrants to buy another $5 billion in Goldman's common stock within five years.[67] The company also raised $5 billion via a public offering of shares at $123 per share.[67] Goldman also received a $10 billion preferred stock investment from the U.S. Treasury in October 2008, as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).[68]\n Andrew Cuomo, then New York Attorney General, questioned Goldman's decision to pay 953 employees bonuses of at least $1 million (~$1.39 million in 2023) each after it received TARP funds in 2008.[69] In that same period, however, CEO Lloyd Blankfein and six other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses, stating they believed it was the right thing to do, in light of \"the fact that we are part of an industry that's directly associated with the ongoing economic distress\".[70] Cuomo called the move \"appropriate and prudent\", and urged the executives of other banks to follow the firm's lead and refuse bonus payments.[70] In June 2009, Goldman Sachs repaid the U.S. Treasury's TARP investment, with 23% interest (in the form of $318 million in preferred dividend payments and $1.418 billion in warrant redemptions).[71] On March 18, 2011, Goldman Sachs received Federal Reserve approval to buy back Berkshire's preferred stock in Goldman.[72] In December 2009, Goldman announced that its top 30 executives would be paid year-end bonuses in restricted stock that they cannot sell for five years, with clawback provisions.[73][74]\n During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve introduced several short-term credit and liquidity facilities to help stabilize markets. Some of the transactions under these facilities provided liquidity to institutions whose disorderly failure could have severely stressed an already fragile financial system.[75] Goldman Sachs was one of the heaviest users of these loan facilities, taking out many loans between March 18, 2008, and April 22, 2009. The Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF), the first Fed facility ever to provide overnight loans to investment banks, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $589 billion against collateral such as corporate market instruments and mortgage-backed securities.[76] The Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF), which allows primary dealers to borrow liquid Treasury securities for one month in exchange for less liquid collateral, loaned Goldman Sachs a total of $193 billion.[77] Goldman Sachs's borrowings totaled $782 billion in hundreds of revolving transactions over these months.[78] The loans were fully repaid in accordance with the terms of the facilities.[79]\n In 2008, Goldman Sachs started a \"Returnship\" internship program after research and consulting with other firms led them to understand that career breaks happen and that returning to the workforce was difficult, especially for women. The goal of the Returnship program was to offer a chance at temporary employment for workers. Goldman Sachs holds the trademark for the term 'Returnship'.[80] According to a 2009 BrandAsset Valuator survey taken of 17,000 people nationwide, the firm's reputation suffered in 2008 and 2009, and rival Morgan Stanley was respected more than Goldman Sachs, a reversal of the sentiment in 2006.[81] In 2011, Goldman took full control of JBWere in a $1 billion (~$1.34 billion in 2023) buyout.[82]\n In September 2011, Goldman Sachs announced that it was shutting down Global Alpha Fund LP, its largest hedge fund, which had been housed under Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM).[83][84] Global Alpha, which was created in the mid-1990s with $10 million,[85] was once \"one of the biggest and best performing hedge funds in the world\" with more than $12 billion assets under management (AUM) at its peak in 2007.[86] Global Alpha used quantitative analysis and computer-driven models to invest,[83] using high-frequency trading. It  was founded by Cliff Asness and Mark Carhart, who developed the statistical models on which the trading was based.[85] Global Alpha was described by The Wall Street Journal as a \"big, secretive hedge fund\"—the \"Cadillac of a fleet of alternative investments\" that had made millions for Goldman Sachs by 2006.[87] By mid-2008, assets under management (AUM) of the fund had declined to $2.5 billion, by June 2011, AUM was less than $1.7 billion, and by September 2011, after suffering losses that year, AUM was approximately $1 billion.[88]\n In 2013, Goldman underwrote the $2.913 billion (~$3.76 billion in 2023) Grand Parkway System Toll Revenue Bond offering for the Houston, Texas area, one of the fastest-growing areas in the United States. The bond will be repaid from toll revenue.[89][90]\n In April 2013, together with Deutsche Bank, Goldman led a $17 billion bond offering by Apple Inc., the largest corporate-bond deal in history[91][92] and Apple's first since 1996. Goldman Sachs managed both of Apple's previous bond offerings in the 1990s.[92]\n In June 2013, Goldman Sachs purchased the loan portfolio from Brisbane-based Suncorp Group, one of Australia's largest banks and insurance companies. The A$1.6 billion face amount loan portfolio was purchased for A$960 million.[93][94]\n In September 2013, Goldman Sachs Asset Management agreed to acquire the stable value business of Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, with total assets under supervision of $21.6 billion (~$27.9 billion in 2023) as of June 30, 2013[update].[95]\n In 2014, Goldman Sachs acquired an 18% stake in DONG Energy (now Ørsted A/S), the largest electric utility in Denmark, from the Danish government after the company needed fresh capital but was unable to attract state funding.[96] The sale led to protests by the public in Copenhagen and led to the resignation of six cabinet ministers and the withdrawal of the Socialist People's Party from Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt's leftist governing coalition.[97] Protesters were wary of Goldman having an ownership stake due to its role in the 2007–2008 financial crisis and the possible shift of the company's earnings to tax havens.[97] Additional protests occurred in 2016 when the initial public offering of the company resulted in a windfall profit for Goldman.[98] Goldman purchased the 18% stake in 2014 for 8 billion kroner and sold just over a 6% stake in 2017 for 6.5 billion kroner.[99] Goldman sold its remaining stake in the utility in 2017.[100]\n In January 2014, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) filed a lawsuit against Goldman for $1 billion after the firm lost 98% of the $1.3 billion the LIA invested with Goldman in 2007.[101][102] The losses stemmed from derivatives trades that earned Goldman $350 million in fees.[103][104] In court documents, Goldman admitted to having used small gifts, occasional travel and an internship to gain access to Libya's sovereign wealth fund.[105] In October 2016, after a trial, Justice Vivien Rose entered a judgment in Goldman Sachs's favor, saying that the relationship \"did not go beyond the normal cordial and mutually beneficial relationship that grows up between a bank and a client\" and that Goldman's fees were not excessive.[106]\n In August 2015, Goldman Sachs agreed to acquire General Electric's GE Capital Bank on-line deposit platform, including US$8-billion of on-line deposits and another US$8-billion of brokered certificates of deposit.[107]\n In April 2016, Goldman Sachs launched GS Bank, a direct bank.[108] In October 2016, Goldman Sachs Bank USA started offering no-fee unsecured personal loans under the brand Marcus by Goldman Sachs.[109] In March 2016, Goldman Sachs agreed to acquire financial technology startup Honest Dollar, a digital retirement savings tool founded by American entrepreneur Whurley, focused on helping small-business employees and self-employed workers obtain affordable retirement plans. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.[110]\n In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion (~$3.42 billion in 2023) of PDVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela during the 2017 Venezuelan protests.[111]\n In April 2018, Goldman Sachs acquired Clarity Money, a personal finance startup.[112] On September 10, 2018, Goldman Sachs acquired Boyd Corporation from Genstar Capital for $3 billion (~$3.59 billion in 2023).[113] On May 16, 2019, Goldman Sachs acquired United Capital Financial Advisers, LLC for $750 million (~$882 million in 2023).[114]\n In March 2019, Apple, Inc. announced that it would partner with Goldman Sachs to launch the Apple Card, the bank's first credit card offering.[115] The partnership opportunity had been turned down by other banks including Barclays, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Synchrony Financial.[116][117]\n In March 2019, Goldman Sachs was fined £34.4 million by the London regulator for misreporting millions of transactions over a decade.[118]\n In December 2019, the company pledged to invest and finance $750 billion in climate transition projects and to stop financing oil exploration in the Arctic and some projects related to coal.[119]\n In June 2020, Goldman Sachs introduced a new corporate typeface, Goldman Sans, and made it freely available. After Internet users discovered that the terms of the license prohibited the disparagement of Goldman Sachs, the bank was much mocked and disparaged in its own font, until it eventually changed the license to the standard SIL Open Font License.[120]\n Goldman Sachs was embroiled in the 1Malaysia Development Berhad scandal, related to Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). The bank paid a fine of $2.9 billion under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the largest such fine to date. In July 2020, Goldman Sachs agreed on a $3.9 billion settlement in Malaysia for criminal charges related to the 1MDB scandal.[121][122] For charges brought for the same case in other countries, Goldman Sachs agreed in October of the same year to pay more than $2.9 billion, with over $2 billion going to fines imposed in the US.[123][124]\n Effective July 1, 2020, the firm no longer manages initial public offerings of a company without \"at least one diverse board candidate, with a focus on women\" in the U.S. and in Europe.[125][126]\n In August 2021, Goldman Sachs announced that it had agreed to acquire NN Investment Partners, which had US$ 335 billion in assets under management, for €1.7 billion from NN Group.[127]\n In September 2021, Goldman Sachs announced to acquire GreenSky for about $2.24 billion (~$2.48 billion in 2023) and completed the acquisition in March 2022.[128]\n In March 2022, Goldman Sachs announced it was winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements regarding sanctions after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[129]\n Also during that same month, Goldman Sachs announced it had acquired NextCapital Group, a Chicago-based open-architecture digital retirement advice provider.[130]\n In June 2022, Goldman Sachs offered its first derivatives product linked to Ether (ETH).[131] Goldman Sachs was announced as an official partner of McLaren.[132]\n In September 2022, Goldman Sachs announced the layoff of hundreds of employees across the company, apparently as a result of the earnings report from July the same year that showed a significant reduction.[133]\n In February 2024, CNBC reported Goldman Sachs was expanding its reach into the economic lives of more Americans by way of Rhythm Energy, a provider of independent energy in Texas. The firm's private equity fund owned the firm, but it operated independently. At the time of the reporting, it was linked to energy networks that provided electricity for 190 million Americans.[134]\n The company is growing its Indian business – Goldman Sachs has invested ₹72 crore (₹720 000 000) for 15 lakh (1 500 000) shares in Medi Assist Healthcare debuting in January 2024.[135]\n The company has been criticized for lack of ethical standards,[136] working with dictatorial regimes,[137] close relationships with the U.S. federal government via a \"revolving door\" of former employees,[138] and driving up prices of commodities through futures speculation.[139] It has also been criticized by its employees for 100-hour work weeks, high levels of employee dissatisfaction among first-year analysts, abusive treatment by superiors, a lack of mental health resources, and extremely high levels of stress in the workplace leading to physical discomfort.[140][141]\n Goldman was criticized for allegedly misleading its investors and profiting from the collapse of the mortgage market during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. This led to investigations from the United States Congress, the United States Department of Justice, and a lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission[142] that resulted in Goldman paying a $550 million settlement in July 2010.[143] Goldman Sachs denied wrongdoing and stated that its customers were aware of its bets against the mortgage-related security products it was selling to them, and that it only used those bets to hedge against losses.[144][145]\n Goldman Sachs was \"excoriated by the press and the public\" according to journalists Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera.[146] This was despite the non-retail nature of its business that would normally have kept it out of the public eye.[147] In a story in Rolling Stone published in July 2009, Matt Taibbi characterized Goldman Sachs as a \"great vampire squid\" sucking money instead of blood, allegedly engineering \"every major market manipulation since the Great Depression ... from tech stocks to high gas prices\".[148][149][150][151]\n While all the investment banks were scolded by congressional investigations, Goldman Sachs was subject to \"a solo hearing in front of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations\" and a critical report.[147][152] In 2011, a Senate panel released a report accusing Goldman Sachs of misleading clients and engaging in conflicts of interest.[153]\n In June 2009, after the firm repaid the TARP investment from the U.S. Treasury, Goldman made some of the largest bonus payments in its history due to its strong financial performance, setting aside a record $11.4 billion for bonus payments.[147][154][155][156][157] Andrew Cuomo, then New York Attorney General, questioned Goldman's decision to pay 953 employees bonuses of at least $1 million each after it received TARP funds in 2008.[158] That same period, however, CEO Lloyd Blankfein and 6 other senior executives opted to forgo bonuses, stating they believed it was the right thing to do because they were part of the industry that caused economic distress.[159]\n American International Group received $180 billion in government loans during the financial crisis, much of which was used to pay counterparties under credit default swaps purchased from AIG. Goldman Sachs received $12.9 billion. However, due to the size and nature of the payouts, there was considerable controversy in the media and among some politicians as to whether banks, including Goldman Sachs, should have been forced to take greater losses and should not have been paid in full via government loans to AIG.[160][161][162][163][164][165] If the government let AIG default, according to money manager Michael Lewitt, \"its collapse would be as close to an extinction-level event as the financial markets have seen since the Great Depression\".[166]\n Goldman Sachs maintained that its net exposure to AIG was \"not material\", and that the firm was protected by hedges (in the form of CDSs with other counterparties) and $7.5 billion of collateral, which would have protected the bank from incurring an economic loss in the event of an AIG bankruptcy or failure.[167][168] The firm stated the cost of these hedges to be over $100 million.[169] CFO David Viniar stated that profits related to AIG in the first quarter of 2009 \"rounded to zero\", and profits in December were not significant and that he was \"mystified\" by the interest the government and investors have shown in the bank's trading relationship with AIG.[170] Speculation remains that Goldman's hedges against its AIG exposure would not have paid out if AIG was allowed to fail. According to a report by the United States Office of the Inspector General of TARP, if AIG had collapsed, it would have made it difficult for Goldman to liquidate its trading positions with AIG, even at discounts, and it also would have put pressure on other counterparties that \"might have made it difficult for Goldman Sachs to collect on the credit protection it had purchased against an AIG default.\" Finally, the report said, an AIG default would have forced Goldman Sachs to bear the risk of declines in the value of billions of dollars in collateral debt obligations.[171] Goldman argued that CDSs are marked to market (i.e. valued at their current market price) and their positions netted between counterparties daily. Thus, as the cost of insuring AIG's obligations against default rose substantially in the lead-up to its bailout, the sellers of the CDS contracts had to post more collateral to Goldman Sachs. The firm claims this meant its hedges were effective and the firm would have been protected against an AIG bankruptcy and the risk of knock-on defaults, had AIG been allowed to fail.[172] However, in practice, the collateral would not protect fully against losses both because protection sellers would not be required to post collateral that covered the complete loss during a bankruptcy and because the value of the collateral would be highly uncertain following the repercussions of an AIG bankruptcy.[173]\n Although many have said there is no evidence to support the claim,[174] some have argued that Goldman Sachs received preferential treatment from the government by participating in the crucial September meetings at the New York Fed, which decided AIG's fate. Much of this has stemmed from an inaccurate but often quoted article published in The New York Times.[175] The article was later corrected to state that Blankfein, CEO of Goldman Sachs, was \"one of the Wall Street chief executives at the meeting\". Representatives from other firms were indeed present at the September AIG meetings. Furthermore, Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar stated that CEO Blankfein had never \"met\" with US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to discuss AIG;[176] however, they had frequent phone calls.[177] Paulson was not present at the September meetings at the New York Fed. Morgan Stanley was hired by the Federal Reserve to advise on the AIG bailout.[178] According to The New York Times, Paulson spoke with the CEO of Goldman Sachs two dozen times during the week of the bailout, though he obtained an ethics waiver before doing so.[179] While it is common for regulators to be in contact with market participants to gather valuable industry intelligence, particularly in a crisis, Paulson spoke with Goldman's Blankfein more frequently than with other large banks. Federal officials say that although Paulson was involved in decisions to rescue A.I.G, it was the Federal Reserve that played the lead role in shaping and financing the A.I.G. bailout.[179]\n Goldman Sachs was charged for repeatedly issuing research reports with extremely inflated financial projections for Exodus Communications and Goldman Sachs was accused of giving Exodus its highest stock rating even though Goldman knew Exodus did not deserve such a rating.[180] On July 15, 2003, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley were sued for artificially inflating the stock price of RSL Communications by issuing untrue or materially misleading statements in research analyst reports, and paid $3,380,000 (~$5.37 million in 2023) for settlement.[181]\n Goldman Sachs was accused of asking for kickback bribes from institutional clients who made large profits flipping stocks which Goldman had intentionally undervalued in initial public offerings it was underwriting during the dot-com bubble. Documents under seal in a decade-long lawsuit concerning eToys.com's initial public offering (IPO) in 1999 but released accidentally to The New York Times show that IPOs managed by Goldman were purposely underpriced to generate profits for clients of Goldman and that these clients were asked by Goldman to return some of the profits via increased business. The clients willingly complied with these demands because they understood it was necessary to participate in further such undervalued IPOs.[182] Companies selling undervalued stock and their initial consumer stockholders were both defrauded by this practice.[183]\n A 2016 report by Public Interest Research Group stated that \"Goldman Sachs reports having 987 subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, 537 of which are in the Cayman Islands, despite not operating a single legitimate office in that country, according to its own website. The group officially holds $28.6 billion offshore.\" The report also noted several other major U.S. banks and companies use the same tax-avoidance tactics.[184]\n In 2008, Goldman Sachs had an effective tax rate of only 3.8%, down from 34% the year before, and its tax liability decreased to $14 million in 2008, compared to $6 billion in 2007.[185] Critics have argued that the reduction in Goldman Sachs's tax rate was achieved by shifting its earnings to subsidiaries in low or no-tax nations, such as the Cayman Islands.[186]\n Goldman was criticized for its involvement in the 2010 European debt crisis. In 2001, to avoid non-compliance with the Maastricht Treaty, Goldman arranged a secret loan of €2.8 billion for Greece disguised as an off-the-books \"cross-currency swap\", hiding 2% of Greece's national debt. Goldman received a fee of €600 million for the complicated transaction.[187][188] In September 2009, Goldman Sachs, among others, created a special credit default swap (CDS) index to cover the high risk of Greece's national debt.[189] The interest-rates of Greek national bonds soared, leading the Greek economy very close to bankruptcy in 2010 and 2011.[190]\n Many European leaders with roles in the crisis had ties to Goldman Sachs.[191] Lucas Papademos, Greece's former prime minister, ran the Central Bank of Greece at the time of the controversial derivatives deals with Goldman Sachs that enabled Greece to hide the size of its debt.[191] Petros Christodoulou, general manager of the Greek Public Debt Management Agency was a former employee of Goldman Sachs.[191] Mario Monti, Italy's former prime minister and finance minister, who headed the new government that took over after Berlusconi's resignation, was an international adviser to Goldman Sachs.[191] Otmar Issing, former board member of the Bundesbank and the executive board of the European Bank also advised Goldman Sachs.[191] Mario Draghi, then head of the European Central Bank, was the former managing director of Goldman Sachs International.[191] António Borges, Head of the European Department of the International Monetary Fund in 2010–2011 and responsible for most of enterprise privatizations in Portugal since 2011, was the former vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.[191] Carlos Moedas, a former Goldman Sachs employee, was the Secretary of State to the Prime Minister of Portugal and Director of ESAME, the agency created to monitor and control the implementation of the structural reforms agreed by the government of Portugal and the troika composed of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Peter Sutherland, former Attorney General of Ireland was a non-executive director of Goldman Sachs International.[192]\n Although the allegations against Goldman were later discovered to be lacking evidence, in March 2012, Greg Smith, then-head of Goldman Sachs U.S. equity derivatives sales business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), resigned his position via an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing the company and its executives and wrote a book titled Why I left Goldman Sachs.[136][193][194][195][196] Almost all the claims made by Smith turned out to be lacking in evidence and Smith was alleged to be a con artist by The Observer. However, The New York Times never issued a retraction or admitted to any error in judgment in initially publishing Smith's op-ed.[196][197][198]\n In 2014, a book by former Goldman portfolio manager Steven George Mandis was published entitled What Happened to Goldman Sachs: An Insider's Story of Organizational Drift and Its Unintended Consequences. Mandis also wrote and defended a PhD dissertation about Goldman at Columbia University.[199] Mandis left in 2004 after working for the firm for 12 years.[200] According to Mandis, there was an \"organizational drift\" in the company's evolution and Goldman came under a variety of pressures that resulted in slow, incremental changes to its culture and business practices. Those changes included becoming a public company, which limited the personal risk of Goldman executives and shifted it to shareholders and put pressure on the company to grow, leading to conflicts of interest.[201]\n In 2021, a group of first year bankers told managers that they are working 100 hours a week with 5 hours sleep at night and that they have been constantly experiencing workplace abuse that has seriously affected their mental health. In May 2022, Goldman Sachs implemented a more flexible vacation policy to help their employees \"rest and recharge\" whereby senior bankers get unlimited vacation days, and all employees are expected to take a minimum of 15 days vacation every year.[202]\n In 2010, two former female employees filed a lawsuit against Goldman Sachs for gender discrimination. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich claimed that the firm fostered an \"uncorrected culture of sexual harassment and assault\" causing women to either be \"sexualized or ignored\". The suit cited both cultural and pay discrimination including frequent client trips to strip clubs, client golf outings that excluded female employees, and the fact that female vice presidents made 21% less than their male counterparts.[203] In March 2018, the judge ruled that the female employees may pursue their claims as a group in a class-action lawsuit against Goldman on gender bias, but the class action excludes their claim on sexual harassment.[204]\n In May 2023, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $215 million (£170.5 million) to resolve claims made by nearly 2800 female staff. This settlement was made over accusations of the company's discriminatory practices, allegedly providing women with lower salaries and lesser opportunities. Government records have revealed that female employees at Goldman Sachs earned 20% less than their male counterparts, which is significantly higher than the 9.4% national gender pay gap. The settlement was reached a month before the scheduled trial of the class-action lawsuit.[205]\n On March 13, 2024, WSJ reported that roughly two-thirds of the women who were partners at the end of 2018 have left the firm or no longer have the title. No woman runs a major division or is seen as a credible candidate to succeed Solomon. Only two of the eight executive officers at Goldman are women – in legal and accounting, non-revenue generating positions.[206]\n On November 11, 2008, the Los Angeles Times reported that Goldman Sachs had both earned $25 million from underwriting California bonds, and advised other clients to short those bonds.[207] While some journalists criticized the contradictory actions,[208] others pointed out that the opposite investment decisions undertaken by the underwriting side and the trading side of the bank were normal and in line with regulations regarding Chinese walls, and in fact critics had demanded increased independence between underwriting and trading.[209]\n Several people on the list of former employees of Goldman Sachs have later worked in government positions. Notable examples include British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, former U.S. Secretaries of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin, Robert Rubin, and Henry Paulson; U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler; former Under Secretary of State John C. Whitehead; former chief economic advisor Gary Cohn; Governor of New Jersey Phil Murphy and former Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine; former Prime Minister of Italy Mario Monti; former European Central Bank President and former Prime Minister of Italy Mario Draghi; former Bank of Canada and Bank of England Governor Mark Carney; and the former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull. In addition, former Goldman employees have headed the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange Group, the World Bank, and competing banks such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.\n During 2008 Goldman Sachs received criticism for an apparent revolving door relationship, in which its employees and consultants moved in and out of high-level U.S. Government positions, creating the potential for conflicts of interest and leading to the moniker \"Government Sachs\".[138] Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and former United States Senator and former Governor of New Jersey Jon Corzine are former CEOs of Goldman Sachs along with current governor Murphy. Additional controversy attended the selection of former Goldman Sachs lobbyist Mark A. Patterson as chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, despite President Barack Obama's campaign promise that he would limit the influence of lobbyists in his administration.[210] In February 2011, the Washington Examiner reported that Goldman Sachs was \"the company from which Obama raised the most money in 2008\", and that its \"CEO Lloyd Blankfein has visited the White House 10 times\".[211]\n In 1986, Goldman Sachs investment banker David Brown pleaded guilty to charges of passing inside information on a takeover deal that eventually was provided to Ivan Boesky.[212] In 1989, Robert M. Freeman, who was a senior Partner, who was the Head of Risk Arbitrage, and who was a protégé of Robert Rubin, pleaded guilty to insider trading, for his own account and for the firm's account.[213]\n In April 2010, Goldman director Rajat Gupta was named in an insider-trading case after allegedly informing Raj Rajaratnam of Galleon Group about the $5 billion Berkshire Hathaway investment in Goldman during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Gupta had told Goldman the month before his involvement became public that he wouldn't seek re-election as a director.[214][215] The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced civil charges against Gupta covering the Berkshire investment as well as for providing confidential quarterly earnings information from Goldman and Procter & Gamble, on which Gupta served as a member of the board of directors. Gupta was an investor in some of the Galleon hedge funds and he had other business interests with Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam used the information from Gupta to illegally profit in hedge fund trades; the information on Goldman made Rajaratnam's funds $17 million richer and the Procter & Gamble data created illegal profits of more than $570,000 for Galleon funds managed by others. Gupta denied the accusations. He was also a board member of AMR Corporation.[216][217]\n Gupta was convicted in June 2012 on insider trading charges stemming from the cases on four criminal felony counts of conspiracy and securities fraud. He was sentenced in October 2012 to two years in prison, an additional year on supervised release and ordered to pay $5 million (~$6.56 million in 2023) in fines.[218] In January 2016, he was released from prison to serve his remaining sentence at home.[219] Gupta challenged the conviction through the courts; it was upheld in 2019.[220]\n \n Unlike many investors and investment bankers, Goldman Sachs anticipated the subprime mortgage crisis.[221] Some of its traders became \"bearish\" on the housing boom beginning in 2004 and developed mortgage-related securities, originally intended to protect Goldman from investment losses in the housing market. In late 2006, Goldman management changed the firm's overall stance on the mortgage market from positive to negative. As the market began its downturn, Goldman \"created even more of these securities\", no longer just hedging or satisfying investor orders but, according to business journalist Gretchen Morgenson, \"enabling it to pocket huge profits\" from the mortgage defaults and that Goldman \"used the C.D.O.'s to place unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes\".[221] Authors Bethany McLean and Joe Nocera stated that \"the firm's later insistence that it was merely a 'market maker' in these transactions – implying that it had no stake in the economic performance of the securities it was selling to clients – became less true over time\"-[222]\n The investments were called synthetic CDOs because unlike regular collateralized debt obligations, the principal and interest they paid out came not from mortgages or other loans, but from premiums to pay for insurance against mortgage defaults – the insurance known as \"credit default swaps\". Goldman and some other hedge funds held a \"short\" position in the securities, paying the premiums, while the investors (insurance companies, pension funds, etc.) receiving the premiums were the \"long\" position. The longs were responsible for paying the insurance \"claim\" to Goldman and any other shorts if the mortgages or other loans defaulted. Through April 2007, Goldman issued over 20 CDOs in its \"Abacus\" series worth a total of $10.9 billion (~$15.4 billion in 2023).[223] All together Goldman packaged, sold, and shorted a total of 47 synthetic CDOs, with an aggregate face value of $66 billion between July 1, 2004, and May 31, 2007.[224]\n But while Goldman was praised for its foresight, some argued its bets against the securities it created gave it a vested interest in their failure. These securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by April 2010, at least US$5 billion (~$6.82 billion in 2023) worth of the securities either carried \"junk\" ratings or had defaulted.[225] One CDO examined by critics which Goldman bet against but also sold to investors, was the $800 million (~$1.16 billion in 2023) Hudson Mezzanine CDO issued in 2006. In the Senate Permanent Subcommittee hearings, Goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books. Unable to sell them directly, it included them in the underlying securities of the CDO and took the short side, but critics McLean and Nocera complained the CDO prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as \"'assets sourced from the Street', making it sound as though Goldman randomly selected the securities, instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book\".[226] The CDO did not perform well, and by March 2008 – just 18 months after its issue – so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out \"about US$310 million to Goldman and others who had bet against it\".[221] Goldman's head of European fixed-income sales lamented in an e-mail made public by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the \"real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients\" who had invested in the CDO. \"The damage this has done to our franchise is very significant.\"[227]\n In April 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Goldman Sachs and one of its vice-presidents, Fabrice Tourre, with securities fraud. The SEC alleged that Goldman had told buyers of a synthetic CDO, a type of investment, that the underlying assets in the investment had been picked by an independent CDO manager, ACA Management. In fact, Paulson & Co. a hedge fund that wanted to bet against the investment had played a \"significant role\" in the selection,[142] and the package of securities turned out to become \"one of the worst-performing mortgage deals of the housing crisis\" because \"less than a year after the deal was completed, 100% of the bonds selected for Abacus had been downgraded\".[228]\n The particular synthetic CDO that the SEC's 2010 fraud suit charged Goldman with misleading investors with was called Abacus 2007-AC1. Unlike many of the Abacus securities, 2007-AC1 did not have Goldman Sachs as a short seller, in fact, Goldman Sachs lost money on the deal.[229] That position was taken by the customer (John Paulson) who hired Goldman to issue the security (according to the SEC's complaint). Paulson and his employees selected 90 BBB-rated mortgage bonds[228][230] that they believed were most likely to lose value and so the best bet to buy insurance for.[143] Paulson and the manager of the CDO, ACA Management, worked on the portfolio of 90 bonds to be insured (ACA allegedly unaware of Paulson's short position), coming to an agreement in late February 2007.[230] Paulson paid Goldman approximately US$15 million for its work in the deal.[231] Paulson ultimately made a US$1 billion profit from the short investments, the profits coming from the losses of the investors and their insurers. These were primarily IKB Deutsche Industriebank (US$150 million loss), and the investors and insurers of another US$900 million – ACA Financial Guaranty Corp,[232] ABN AMRO, and the Royal Bank of Scotland.[233][234]\n The SEC alleged that Goldman \"materially misstated and omitted facts in disclosure documents\" about the financial security,[142] including the fact that it had \"permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market [the hedge fund manager Paulson & Co.] to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party\", ACA Management.[233][235] The SEC further alleged that \"Tourre also misled ACA into believing ... that Paulson's interests in the collateral section [sic] process were aligned with ACA's, when, in reality, Paulson's interests were sharply conflicting\".[233]\n In reply, Goldman issued a statement saying the SEC's charges were \"unfounded in law and fact\", and in later statements maintained that it had not structured the portfolio to lose money,[236] that it had provided extensive disclosure to the long investors in the CDO, that it had lost $90 million, that ACA selected the portfolio without Goldman suggesting Paulson was to be a long investor, that it did not disclose the identities of a buyer to a seller, and vice versa, as it was not normal business practice for a market maker,[236] and that ACA was itself the largest purchaser of the Abacus pool, investing US$951 million. Goldman also stated that any investor losses resulted from the overall negative performance of the entire sector, rather than from a particular security in the CDO.[236][237] While some journalists and analysts have called these statements misleading,[232] others believed Goldman's defense was strong and the SEC's case was weak.[238][239][240]\n Some experts on securities law such as Duke University law professor James Cox, believed the suit had merit because Goldman was aware of the relevance of Paulson's involvement and took steps to downplay it. Others, including Wayne State University Law School law professor Peter Henning, noted that the major purchasers were sophisticated investors capable of accurately assessing the risks involved, even without knowledge of the part played by Paulson.[241]\n Critics of Goldman Sachs point out that Paulson went to Goldman Sachs after being turned down for ethical reasons by another investment bank, Bear Stearns who he had asked to build a CDO. Ira Wagner, the head of Bear Stearns's CDO Group in 2007, told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that having the short investors select the referenced collateral as a serious conflict of interest and the structure of the deal Paulson was proposing encouraged Paulson to pick the worst assets.[242][243] Describing Bear Stearns's reasoning, one author compared the deal to \"a bettor asking a football owner to bench a star quarterback to improve the odds of his wager against the team\".[244] Goldman claimed it lost $90 million, critics maintain it was simply unable (not due to a lack of trying) to shed its position before the underlying securities defaulted.[229]\n Critics also question whether the deal was ethical, even if it was legal.[245][246] Goldman had considerable advantages over its long customers. According to McLean and Nocera, there were dozens of securities being insured in the CDO – for example, another ABACUS[247] – had 130 credits from several different mortgage originators, commercial mortgage-backed securities, debt from Sallie Mae, credit cards, etc. Goldman bought mortgages to create securities, which made it \"far more likely than its clients to have early knowledge\" that the housing bubble was deflating and the mortgage originators like New Century had begun to falsify documentation and sell mortgages to customers unable to pay the mortgage-holders back[248] – which is why the fine print on at least one ABACUS prospectus warned long investors that the 'Protection Buyer' (Goldman) 'may have information, including material, non-public information' which it was not providing to the long investors.[248]\n According to an article in the Houston Chronicle, critics also worried that Abacus might undermine the position of the United States \"as a safe harbor for the world's investors\" and that \"The involvement of European interests as losers in this allegedly fixed game has attracted the attention of that region's political leaders, most notably British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who has accused Goldman of \"moral bankruptcy\". This is, in short, a big global story ... Is what Goldman Sachs did with its Abacus investment vehicle illegal? That will be for the courts to decide, ... But it doesn't take a judge and jury to conclude that, legalities aside, this was just wrong.\"[246]\n On July 15, 2010, Goldman settled out of court, agreeing to pay the SEC and investors US$550 million, including $300 million to the U.S. government and $250 million to investors, one of the largest penalties ever paid by a Wall Street firm.[143] The company did not admit or deny wrongdoing, but did admit that its marketing materials for the investment \"contained incomplete information\", and agreed to change some of its business practices regarding mortgage investments.[143]\n The settlement in July 2010 did not cover charges against Goldman vice president and salesman for Abacus, Fabrice Tourre.[229][143] Tourre unsuccessfully sought a dismissal of the suit,[249][250] which went to trial in 2013.[251] On August 1, a federal jury found Tourre liable on six of seven counts, including that he misled investors about the mortgage deal. He was found not liable on the most specific charge, that he  deliberately made an untrue or misleading statement.[252][253] Tourre was not subject to criminal charges or jail time.[254] He was fined $650,000 and forced to return a $175,000 bonus.[255] Tourre then pursued a career in academia.[256]\n A provision of the 1999 financial deregulation law, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, allows commercial banks to enter into any business activity that is \"complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally\".[257] Since the passing of the laws, Goldman Sachs and other investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase have branched out into ownership of a wide variety of enterprises including raw materials, such as food products, zinc, copper, tin, nickel and, aluminum.\n Some critics, such as Matt Taibbi, believe that allowing a company to both \"control the supply of crucial physical commodities, and also trade in the financial products that might be related to those markets\", is \"akin to letting casino owners who take book on NFL games during the week also coach all the teams on Sundays\".[257]\n Frederick Kaufman, a contributing editor of Harper's Magazine, argued in a 2010 article that Goldman's creation of the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (now the S&P GSCI) helped passive investors such as pension funds, mutual funds and others engage in food price speculation by betting on financial products based on the commodity index. These financial products disturbed the normal relationship between supply and demand, making prices more volatile and defeating the price stabilization mechanism of the futures exchange.[258][259][260]\n A June 2010 article in The Economist defended commodity investors and oil index-tracking funds, citing a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that found that commodities without futures markets and ignored by index-tracking funds also saw price rises during the period.[261]\n Although it was described by others as just a conspiracy theory,[262][263] in a July 2013 article, David Kocieniewski, a journalist with The New York Times, accused Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms of \"capitalizing on loosened federal regulations\" to manipulate \"a variety of commodities markets\", particularly aluminum, citing \"financial records, regulatory documents, and interviews with people involved in the activities\".[139] After Goldman Sachs purchased aluminum warehousing company Metro International in 2010, the wait of warehouse customers for delivery of aluminum supplies to their factories – to make beer cans, home siding, and other products – went from an average of 6 weeks to more than 16 months.[150][139] The premium on all aluminum sold in the spot market doubled, with industry analysts blaming the lengthy delays at Metro International, costing American consumers more than $5 billion from 2010 to 2013.[139] Goldman's ownership of a quarter of the national supply of aluminum – a million and a half tons – in a network of 27 Metro International warehouses in Detroit, Michigan, was blamed.[139][264] To avoid hoarding and price manipulation, the London Metal Exchange requires that \"at least 3,000 tons of that metal must be moved out each day\". According to the article, Goldman dealt with this requirement by moving the aluminum – not to factories, but \"from one warehouse to another\".[139]\n In August 2013, Goldman Sachs was subpoenaed by the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission as part of an investigation into complaints that Goldman-owned metals warehouses had \"intentionally created delays and inflated the price of aluminum\".[265]\n According to Lydia DePillis of Wonkblog, when Goldman bought the warehouses it \"started paying traders extra to bring their metal\" to Goldman's warehouses \"rather than anywhere else. The longer it stays, the more rent Goldman can charge, which is then passed on to the buyer in the form of a premium.\"[266] The effect is \"amplified\" by another company, Glencore, which is \"doing the same thing in its warehouse in Vlissingen\".[266]\n Columnist Matt Levine, writing for Bloomberg News, described the conspiracy theory as \"pretty silly\", but said that it was a rational outcome of an irrational and inefficient system which Goldman Sachs may not have properly understood.[262]\n In December 2014, Goldman Sachs sold its aluminum warehousing business to Ruben Brothers.[267][268][269]\n In March 2015, the legal case against Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Glencore, the two investment banks' warehousing businesses, and the London Metal Exchange in various combinations – of violating U.S. anti-trust laws, was dismissed by United States District Court for the Southern District of New York Judge Katherine B. Forrest in Manhattan for lack of evidence and other reasons.[270] The lawsuit was revived in 2019 after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said the previous decision was in error. That case was dismissed by judge Paul A. Engelmayer in 2021 although Reynolds Consumer Products and two other plaintiffs that had directly transacted with the defendants were allowed to pursue the case.[271] Those purchasers settled with Goldman and JPMorgan Chase in 2022.[272]\n Investment banks, including Goldman, have also been accused of driving up the price of gasoline by speculating on the oil futures exchange. In August 2011, \"confidential documents\" were leaked \"detailing the positions\"[273] in the oil futures market of several investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays, just before the peak in gasoline prices in the summer of 2008. The presence of positions by investment banks on the market was significant for the fact that the banks have deep pockets, and so the means to significantly sway prices, and unlike traditional market participants, neither produced oil nor ever took physical possession of actual barrels of oil they bought and sold. Journalist Kate Sheppard of Mother Jones called it \"a development that many say is artificially raising the price of crude\".[273] However, another source stated that, \"Just before crude oil hit its record high in mid-2008, 15 of the world's largest banks were betting that prices would fall, according to private trading data...\"[274]\n In April 2011, a couple of observers – Brad Johnson of the blog Climate Progress,[275] founded by Joseph J. Romm, and Alain Sherter of CBS MoneyWatch[276] – noted that Goldman Sachs was warning investors of a dangerous spike in the price of oil. Climate Progress quoted Goldman as warning \"that the price of oil has grown out of control due to excessive speculation\" in petroleum futures, and that \"net speculative positions are four times as high as in June 2008\", when the price of oil peaked.[274]\n It stated that, \"Goldman Sachs told its clients that it believed speculators like itself had artificially driven the price of oil at least $20 higher than supply and demand dictate.\"[275] Sherter noted that Goldman's concern over speculation did not prevent it (along with other speculators) from lobbying against regulations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to establish \"position limits\", which would cap the number of futures contracts a trader can hold, and thus prevent speculation.[276]\n \nAccording to Joseph P. Kennedy II, by 2012, prices on the oil commodity market had become influenced by \"hedge funds and bankers\" pumping \"billions of purely speculative dollars into commodity exchanges, chasing a limited number of barrels and driving up the price\".[277] The problem started, according to Kennedy, in 1991, when  just a few years after oil futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Goldman Sachs made an argument to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission that Wall Street dealers who put down big bets on oil should be considered legitimate hedgers and granted an exemption from regulatory limits on their trades.\nThe commission granted an exemption that ultimately allowed Goldman Sachs to process billions of dollars in speculative oil trades. Other exemptions followed,[277]  and \"by 2008, eight investment banks accounted for 32% of the total oil futures market\".[277]\n In January 2016, Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $15 million after it was found that a team of Goldman employees, between 2008 and 2013, \"granted locates\" by arranging to borrow securities to settle short sales without adequate review. However, U.S. regulation for short selling requires brokerages to enter an agreement to borrow securities on behalf of customers or to have \"reasonable grounds\" for believing that it can borrow the security before entering contracts to complete the sale. Additionally, Goldman Sachs gave \"incomplete and unclear\" responses to information requests from SEC compliance examiners in 2013 about the firm's securities lending practices.[278]\n In July 2009, Prime Minister of Malaysia Najib Razak set up a sovereign wealth fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).[279][280][281]\n In 2015, U.S. prosecutors began examining the role of Goldman in helping 1MDB raise more than $6 billion (~$7.54 billion in 2023). The 1MDB bond deals were said to generate \"above-average\" commissions and fees for Goldman amounting close to $600 million or more than 9% of the proceeds.[282]\n Beginning in 2016, Goldman was investigated for a $3 billion (~$3.73 billion in 2023) bond created by the bank for 1MDB. U.S. Prosecutors investigated whether the bank failed to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires financial institutions to report suspicious transactions to regulators.[283] In November 2018, Goldman's former chairman of Southeast Asia, Tim Leissner, admitted that more than US$200 million (~$239 million in 2023) in proceeds from 1MDB bonds went into the accounts controlled by him and a relative, bypassing the company's compliance rules.[284][285] Leissner and another former Goldman banker, Roger Ng, together with Malaysian financier Jho Low were charged with money laundering.[286] Goldman chief executive David Solomon felt \"horrible\" about the ex-staff breaking the law by going around the policies[287][288] and apologized to Malaysians for Leissner's role in the 1MDB scandal.[289][290][291]\n On December 17, 2018, Malaysia filed criminal charges against subsidiaries of Goldman and their former employees Leissner and Ng, alleging their commission of misleading statements to dishonestly misappropriate US$2.7 billion from the proceeds of 1MDB bonds arranged and underwritten by Goldman in 2012 and 2013.[292][293]\n On July 24, 2020, it was announced that the Malaysian government would receive US$2.5 billion in cash from Goldman Sachs,[294] and a guarantee from the bank they would also return US$1.4 billion in assets linked to 1MDB bonds.[295] Put together this was substantially less than the US$7.5 billion that had been previously demanded by the Malaysian finance minister. At the same time, the Malaysian government agreed to drop all criminal charges against the bank and that it would cease legal proceedings against 17 current and former Goldman directors. Some commentators argued that Goldman secured a very favorable deal.[296] Despite the settlement, Malaysian prime minister called it unfair to the country as the settled amount was not sufficient in September 2023,[297] and Goldman had in the following month sued Malaysia in a London arbitration court over the settlement reached by both parties.[298]\n In October 2020, the Malaysian subsidiary of Goldman Sachs admitted to mistakes in auditing its subsidiary and agreed to pay more than $2.9 billion (~$3.36 billion in 2023) in fines.[124][299][300][301]\n In May 2017, Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion (~$3.42 billion in 2023) of PDVSA 2022 bonds from the Central Bank of Venezuela during the 2017 Venezuelan protests,[111] when the country was suffering from malnutrition and hyperinflation.[302][303] Venezuelan politicians and protesters in New York opposed to President of Venezuela Nicolás Maduro accused Goldman of being of complicit of human rights abuses under the government and declared that the financing would fuel hunger in Venezuela by depriving the government of foreign exchange to import food, leading the securities to be dubbed \"hunger bonds.\"[302] The opposition-led National Assembly voted to ask the United States Congress to investigate the deal, which they called \"immoral, opaque, and hypocritical given the socialist government's anti-Wall Street rhetoric\".[303] National Assembly president Julio Borges said that the funds would \"strengthen the brutal repression\" used against the protestors.[304] Sheila Patel, CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management's international division, said that the incident was a learning experience that taught the bank to focus on environmental, social, and corporate governance issues.[305]\n Note: Financial data in billions of US dollars and employee data in thousands. The data is sourced from the company's SEC Form 10-K from 2000 to 2023.[306]\n The 10 largest shareholders of Goldman Sachs as of August 2024 were:[307]\n According to OpenSecrets, Goldman Sachs and its employees collectively gave $3.3 million in the 2022 United States elections to various candidates, leadership PACs, political parties, 527 groups, and outside spending entities benefiting both major American political parties. The largest beneficiary in 2022 was David McCormick, former CEO of Bridgewater Associates, who received $336,000 in contributions.[308]\n Non-employee members of the board of directors of the company are M. Michele Burns, Mark Flaherty, Kimberley Harris, Kevin Johnson, Ellen J. Kullman, Lakshmi Mittal, Adebayo Ogunlesi, Peter Oppenheimer, Jan E. Tighe, Jessica Uhl, and David Viniar.[309] Non-employee directors receive annual compensation of $100,000 in cash and $350,000 in restricted stock, with an extra $25,000 for committee chairpersons.[309]\n",

        "title": "Stock market crash",
        "content": "A stock market crash is a sudden dramatic decline of stock prices across a major cross-section of a stock market, resulting in a significant loss of paper wealth. Crashes are driven by panic selling and underlying economic factors. They often follow speculation and economic bubbles.\n A stock market crash is a social phenomenon where external economic events combine with crowd psychology in a positive feedback loop where selling by some market participants drives more market participants to sell. Generally speaking, crashes usually occur under the following conditions: a prolonged period of rising stock prices (a bull market) and excessive economic optimism, a market where price–earnings ratios exceed long-term averages, and extensive use of margin debt and leverage by market participants. Other aspects such as wars, large corporate hacks, changes in federal laws and regulations, and natural disasters within economically productive areas may also influence a significant decline in the stock market value of a wide range of stocks. Stock prices for corporations competing against the affected corporations may rise despite the crash.[1]\n There is no numerically specific definition of a stock market crash but the term commonly applies to declines of over 10% in a stock market index over a period of several days. Crashes are often distinguished from bear markets (periods of declining stock market prices that are measured in months or years) as crashes include panic selling and abrupt, dramatic price declines. Crashes are often associated with bear markets; however, they do not necessarily occur simultaneously. Black Monday (1987), for example, did not lead to a bear market. Likewise, the bursting of the Japanese asset price bubble occurred over several years without any notable crashes. Stock market crashes are not common.\n Crashes are generally unexpected. As Niall Ferguson stated, \"Before the crash, our world seems almost stationary, deceptively so, balanced, at a set point. So that when the crash finally hits – as inevitably it will – everyone seems surprised. And our brains keep telling us it’s not time for a crash.\"[2]\n Tulip Mania (1634–1637), in which some single tulip bulbs allegedly sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled artisan, is often considered to be the first recorded economic bubble.\n In 1907 and in 1908, stock prices fell by nearly 50% due to a variety of factors, led by the manipulation of copper stocks by the Knickerbocker Trust Company.[3] Shares of United Copper rose gradually up to October, and thereafter crashed, leading to panic.[4][5] Several investment trusts and banks that had invested their money in the stock market fell and started to close down. Further bank runs were prevented due to the intervention of J. P. Morgan.[6] The panic continued to 1908 and led to the formation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.[7]\n The economy grew for most of the Roaring Twenties. It was a technological golden age, as innovations such as the radio, automobile, aviation, telephone, and the electric power transmission grid were deployed and adopted. Companies that had pioneered these advances, including Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and General Motors, saw their stocks soar. Financial corporations also did well, as Wall Street bankers floated mutual fund companies (then known as investment trusts) like the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation. Investors were infatuated with the returns available in the stock market, especially by the use of leverage through margin debt (i.e., borrowing money from your stockbroker to finance part of your purchase of stocks, using the bought securities as collateral).\n On August 24, 1921, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was at 63.9. By September 3, 1929, it had risen more than sixfold to 381.2. It did not regain this level for another 25 years. By the summer of 1929, it was clear that the economy was contracting, and the stock market went through a series of unsettling price declines. These declines fed investor anxiety, and events came to a head on October 24, 28, and 29 (known respectively as Black Thursday, Black Monday, and Black Tuesday).\n On Black Monday, the DJIA fell 38.33 points to 260, a drop of 12.8%. The deluge of selling overwhelmed the ticker tape system that normally gave investors the current prices of their shares. Telephone lines and telegraphs were clogged and were unable to cope. This information vacuum only led to more fear and panic. The technology of the New Era, previously much celebrated by investors, now served to deepen their suffering.\n The following day, Black Tuesday, was a day of chaos. Forced to liquidate their stocks because of margin calls, overextended investors flooded the exchange with sell orders. The Dow fell 30.57 points to close at 230.07 on that day. The glamour stocks of the age saw their values plummet. Across the two days, the DJIA fell 23%.\n By the end of the weekend of November 11, 1929, the index stood at 228, a cumulative drop of 40% from the September high. The markets rallied in succeeding months, but it was a temporary recovery that led unsuspecting investors into further losses. The DJIA lost 89% of its value before finally bottoming out in July 1932. The crash was followed by the Great Depression, the worst economic crisis of modern times, which plagued the stock market and Wall Street throughout the 1930s.\n The mid-1980s were a time of strong economic optimism. From August 1982 to its peak in August 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose from 776 to 2722. The rise in market indices for the 19 largest markets in the world averaged 296% during this period. The average number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange rose from 65 million shares to 181 million shares.[8]\n The crash on October 19, 1987, Black Monday, was the climactic culmination of a market decline that had begun five days before on October 14. The DJIA fell 3.81% on October 14, followed by another 4.60% drop on Friday, October 16. On Black Monday, the DJIA plummeted 508 points, losing 22.6% of its value in one day. The S&P 500 Index dropped 20.4%, falling from 282.7 to 225.06. The NASDAQ Composite lost only 11.3%, not because of restraint on the part of sellers, but because the NASDAQ market system failed. Deluged with sell orders, many stocks on the NYSE faced trading halts and delays. Of the 2,257 NYSE-listed stocks, there were 195 trading delays and halts during the day.[9] The NASDAQ market fared much worse. Because of its reliance on a \"market making\" system that allowed market makers to withdraw from trading, liquidity in NASDAQ stocks dried up. Trading in many stocks encountered a pathological condition where the bid price for a stock exceeded the ask price. These \"locked\" conditions severely curtailed trading. On October 19, trading in Microsoft shares on the NASDAQ lasted a total of 54 minutes.\n The crash was the greatest single-day loss that Wall Street had ever suffered in continuous trading up to that point. Between the start of trading on October 14 to the close on October 19, the DJIA lost 760 points, a decline of over 31%.\n In October 1987, all major world markets crashed or declined substantially. The FTSE 100 Index lost 10.8% on that Monday and a further 12.2% the following day. The least affected was Austria (a fall of 11.4%) while the most affected was Hong Kong with a drop of 45.8%. Out of 23 major industrial countries, 19 had a decline greater than 20%.[10]\n Despite fears of a repeat of the Great Depression, the market rallied immediately after the crash, posting a record one-day gain of 102.27 the very next day and 186.64 points on Thursday, October 22. It took only two years for the Dow to recover completely; by September 1989, the market had regained all of the value it had lost in the 1987 crash. The DJIA gained 0.6% during calendar year 1987.\n No definitive conclusions have been reached on the reasons behind the 1987 Crash. Stocks had been in a multi-year bull run and market price–earnings ratios in the U.S. were above the post-war average. The S&P 500 was trading at 23 times earnings, a postwar high and well above the average of 14.5 times earnings.[11] Herd behavior and psychological feedback loops play a critical part in all stock market crashes but analysts have also tried to look for external triggering events. Aside from the general worries of stock market overvaluation, blame for the collapse has been apportioned to such factors as program trading, portfolio insurance and derivatives, and prior news of worsening economic indicators (i.e. a large U.S. merchandise trade deficit and a falling U.S. dollar, which seemed to imply future interest rate hikes).[12]\n One of the consequences of the 1987 Crash was the introduction of the circuit breaker or trading curb on the NYSE. Based upon the idea that a cooling-off period would help dissipate panic selling, these mandatory market shutdowns are triggered whenever a large pre-defined market decline occurs during the trading day.\n On September 15, 2008, the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the collapse of Merrill Lynch along with a liquidity crisis of American International Group, all primarily due to exposure to packaged subprime loans and credit default swaps issued to insure these loans and their issuers, rapidly devolved into a global crisis. This resulted in several bank failures in Europe and sharp reductions in the value of stocks and commodities worldwide. The failure of banks in Iceland resulted in a devaluation of the Icelandic króna and threatened the government with bankruptcy. Iceland obtained an emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund in November.[14] In the United States, 15 banks failed in 2008, while several others were rescued through government intervention or acquisitions by other banks.[15] On October 11, 2008, the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that the world financial system was teetering on the \"brink of systemic meltdown\".[16]\n The economic crisis caused countries to close their markets temporarily.\n On October 8, the Indonesian stock market halted trading, after a 10% drop in one day.\n The Times of London reported that the meltdown was being called the Crash of 2008, and older traders were comparing it with Black Monday in 1987. The fall that week of 21% compared to a 28.3% fall 21 years earlier, but some traders were saying it was worse. \"At least then it was a short, sharp, shock on one day. This has been relentless all week.\"[17] Other media also referred to the events as the \"Crash of 2008\".[18]\n From October 6–10, 2008, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed lower in all five sessions. Volume levels were record-breaking. The DJIA fell over 1,874 points, or 18%, in its worst weekly decline ever on both a points and percentage basis. The S&P 500 fell more than 20%.[19] The week also set 3 top ten NYSE Group Volume Records with October 8 at #5, October 9 at #10, and October 10 at #1.\n Having been suspended for three successive trading days (October 9, 10, and 13), the Icelandic stock market reopened on 14 October, with the main index, the OMX Iceland 15, closing at 678.4, which was about 77% lower than the 3,004.6 at the close on October 8. This reflected that the value of the three big banks, which had formed 73.2% of the value of the OMX Iceland 15, had been set to zero.\n On October 24, 2008, many of the world's stock exchanges experienced the worst declines in their history, with drops of around 10% in most indices.[20] In the U.S., the DJIA fell 3.6%, although not as much as other markets.[21] The United States dollar and Japanese yen soared against other major currencies, particularly the British pound and Canadian dollar, as world investors sought safe havens. Later that day, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Charlie Bean, suggested that \"This is a once in a lifetime crisis, and possibly the largest financial crisis of its kind in human history.\"[22]\n By March 6, 2009, the DJIA had dropped 54% to 6,469 from its peak of 14,164 on October 9, 2007, over a span of 17 months, before beginning to recover.[23]\n During the week of February 24–28, 2020, stock markets dropped as the COVID-19 pandemic spread globally. The FTSE 100 dropped 13%, while the DJIA and S&P 500 Index dropped 11–12% in the biggest downward weekly drop since the 2007–2008 financial crisis.\n On Monday, March 9, 2020, after the launch of the 2020 Russia–Saudi Arabia oil price war, the FTSE and other major European stock market indices fell by nearly 8%. Asian markets fell sharply and the S&P 500 Index dropped 7.60%.[24] The Italian FTSE MIB fell 2,323.98 points, or 11.17%.[25]\n On March 12, 2020, a day after US President Donald Trump announced a travel ban from Europe, stock prices again fell sharply. The DJIA declined 9.99% – the largest daily decline since Black Monday (1987) – despite the Federal Reserve announcing it would inject $1.5 trillion into money markets.[26] The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq each dropped by approximately 9.5%. The major European stock market indexes all fell over 10%.[27]\n On March 16, 2020, after it became clear that a recession was inevitable, the DJIA dropped 12.93%, or 2,997 points, the largest point drop since Black Monday (1987), surpassing the drop in the prior week, the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.32%, and the S&P 500 Index dropped 11.98%.[28]\n By the end of May 2020, the stock market indices briefly recovered to their levels at the end of February 2020.[citation needed]\n In June 2020 the Nasdaq surpassed its pre-crash high followed by the S&P 500 in August and the Dow in November.\n The conventional assumption is that stock markets behave according to a random log-normal distribution.[29] This implies that the expected volatility is the same all the time. Among others, mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot suggested as early as 1963 that the statistics prove this assumption incorrect.[30] Mandelbrot observed that large movements in prices (i.e. crashes) are much more common than would be predicted from a log-normal distribution. Mandelbrot and others suggested that the nature of market moves is generally much better explained using non-linear analysis and concepts of chaos theory.[31] This has been expressed in non-mathematical terms by George Soros in his discussions of what he calls reflexivity of markets and their non-linear movement.[32] George Soros said in late October 1987, 'Mr. Robert Prechter's reversal proved to be the crack that started the avalanche'.[33][34]\n Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggests that there is evidence that the frequency of stock market crashes follows an inverse cubic power law.[35] This and other studies such as Didier Sornette's work suggest that stock market crashes are a sign of self-organized criticality in financial markets.[36]\n In 1963, Mandelbrot proposed that instead of following a strict random walk, stock price variations executed a Lévy flight.[37] A Lévy flight is a random walk that is occasionally disrupted by large movements. In 1995, Rosario Mantegna and Gene Stanley analyzed a million records of the S&P 500 Index, calculating the returns over a five-year period.[38] Researchers continue to study this theory, particularly using computer simulation of crowd behavior, and the applicability of models to reproduce crash-like phenomena.\n In 2011, using statistical analysis tools of complex systems, research at the New England Complex Systems Institute found that the panics that lead to crashes come from a dramatic increase in imitation among investors, which always occurred during the year before each market crash. When investors closely follow each other's cues, it is easier for panic to take hold and affect the market. This work is a mathematical demonstration of a significant advance warning sign of impending market crashes.[39][40]\n One mitigation strategy has been the introduction of trading curbs, also known as \"circuit breakers\", which are a trading halt in the cash market and the corresponding trading halt in the derivative markets triggered by the halt in the cash market, all of which are affected based on substantial movements in a broad market indicator. Since their inception after Black Monday (1987), trading curbs have been modified to prevent both speculative gains and dramatic losses within a small time frame.\n There are three thresholds, which represent different levels of decline in the S&P 500 Index: 7% (Level 1), 13% (Level 2), and 20% (Level 3).[41]\n For the CAC 40 stock market index in France, daily price limits are implemented in cash and derivative markets. Securities traded on the markets are divided into three categories according to the number and volume of daily transactions. Price limits for each security vary by category. For instance, for the most liquid category, when the price movement of a security from the previous day's closing price exceeds 10%, trading is suspended for 15 minutes. If the price then goes up or down by more than 5%, transactions are again suspended for 15 minutes. The 5% threshold may apply once more before transactions are halted for the rest of the day. When such a suspension occurs, transactions on options based on the underlying security are also suspended. Further, when stocks representing more than 35% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index are halted, the calculation of the CAC40 Index is suspended and the index is replaced by a trend indicator. When stocks representing less than 25% of the capitalization of the CAC40 Index are halted, trading on the derivative markets are suspended for half an hour or one hour, and additional margin deposits are requested.\n",

        "title": "Blockchain",
        "content": "\n A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently, blockchain transactions are resistant to alteration because, once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks and obtaining network consensus to accept these changes. This protects blockchains against nefarious activities such as creating assets \"out of thin air\", double-spending, counterfeiting, fraud, and theft.[5][6]\n Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P) computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[7]\n A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[8] The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need for a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.[9]\n Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model \"snake oil\";[10] however, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than permissionless ones.[4][11]\n Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation \"Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups\".[12] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][13] They wanted to implement a system wherein document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.[4][14] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times every week since 1995.[15]\n The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]\n In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[16] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early 2020.[17]\n The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto's original paper, but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.[18]\n According to Accenture, an application of the diffusion of innovations theory suggests that blockchains attained a 13.5% adoption rate within financial services in 2016, therefore reaching the early adopters' phase.[19] Industry trade groups joined to create the Global Blockchain Forum in 2016, an initiative of the Chamber of Digital Commerce.\n In May 2018, Gartner found that only 1% of CIOs indicated any kind of blockchain adoption within their organisations, and only 8% of CIOs were in the short-term \"planning or [looking at] active experimentation with blockchain\".[20] For the year 2019 Gartner reported 5% of CIOs believed blockchain technology was a 'game-changer' for their business.[21]\n A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger consisting of records called blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.[3][22] This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.[23] A blockchain database is managed autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass collaboration powered by collective self-interests.[24] Such a design facilitates robust workflow where participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as a value-exchange protocol.[25] A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up to detail the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.[citation needed]\n Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:[26]\n Blocks hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree.[3] Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain.[3] This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the initial block, which is known as the genesis block (Block 0).[28][29] To assure the integrity of a block and the data contained in it, the block is usually digitally signed.[30]\n Sometimes separate blocks can be produced concurrently, creating a temporary fork. In addition to a secure hash-based history, any blockchain has a specified algorithm for scoring different versions of the history so that one with a higher score can be selected over others. Blocks not selected for inclusion in the chain are called orphan blocks.[29] Peers supporting the database have different versions of the history from time to time. They keep only the highest-scoring version of the database known to them. Whenever a peer receives a higher-scoring version (usually the old version with a single new block added) they extend or overwrite their own database and retransmit the improvement to their peers. There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially[31] as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.[3][32]: ch. 08 [33] For example, bitcoin uses a proof-of-work system, where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network. There are a number of methods that can be used to demonstrate a sufficient level of computation. Within a blockchain the computation is carried out redundantly rather than in the traditional segregated and parallel manner.[34]\n The block time is the average time it takes for the network to generate one extra block in the blockchain. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for Ethereum is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.[35]\n A hard fork is a change to the blockchain protocol that is not backward compatible and requires all users to upgrade their software in order to continue participating in the network. In a hard fork, the network splits into two separate versions: one that follows the new rules and one that follows the old rules.\n For example, Ethereum was hard forked in 2016 to \"make whole\" the investors in The DAO, which had been hacked by exploiting a vulnerability in its code. In this case, the fork resulted in a split creating Ethereum and Ethereum Classic chains. In 2014 the Nxt community was asked to consider a hard fork that would have led to a rollback of the blockchain records to mitigate the effects of a theft of 50 million NXT from a major cryptocurrency exchange. The hard fork proposal was rejected, and some of the funds were recovered after negotiations and ransom payment. Alternatively, to prevent a permanent split, a majority of nodes using the new software may return to the old rules, as was the case of bitcoin split on 12 March 2013.[36]\n By storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates some risks that come with data being held centrally.[3] The decentralized blockchain may use ad hoc message passing and distributed networking.[39]\n In a so-called \"51% attack\" a central entity gains control of more than half of a network and can then manipulate that specific blockchain record at will, allowing double-spending.[40]\n Blockchain security methods include the use of public-key cryptography.[41]: 5  A public key (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A private key is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.[3]\n Every node in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain. Data quality is maintained by massive database replication[42] and computational trust. No centralized \"official\" copy exists and no user is \"trusted\" more than any other.[41] Transactions are broadcast to the network using the software. Messages are delivered on a best-effort basis. Early blockchains rely on energy-intensive mining nodes to validate transactions,[29] add them to the block they are building, and then broadcast the completed block to other nodes.[32]: ch. 08  Blockchains use various time-stamping schemes, such as proof-of-work, to serialize changes.[43] Later consensus methods include proof of stake.[29] The growth of a decentralized blockchain is accompanied by the risk of centralization because the computer resources required to process larger amounts of data become more expensive.[44]\n Finality is the level of confidence that the well-formed block recently appended to the blockchain will not be revoked in the future (is \"finalized\") and thus can be trusted. Most distributed blockchain protocols, whether proof of work or proof of stake, cannot guarantee the finality of a freshly committed block, and instead rely on \"probabilistic finality\": as the block goes deeper into a blockchain, it is less likely to be altered or reverted by a newly found consensus.[45]\n Byzantine fault tolerance-based proof-of-stake protocols purport to provide so called \"absolute finality\": a randomly chosen validator proposes a block, the rest of validators vote on it, and, if a supermajority decision approves it, the block is irreversibly committed into the blockchain.[45] A modification of this method, an \"economic finality\", is used in practical protocols, like the Casper protocol used in Ethereum: validators which sign two different blocks at the same position in the blockchain are subject to \"slashing\", where their leveraged stake is forfeited.[45]\n Open blockchains are more user-friendly than some traditional ownership records, which, while open to the public, still require physical access to view. Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.[46][47][48][49][50] Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term \"blockchain\" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) in databases.[51] Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.[52]: 30–31  Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.[46][48] Nikolai Hampton of Computerworld said that \"many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases,\" and \"without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion.\"[10][53]\n An advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed.[31] This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a transport layer.[31]\n Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include proof of work. To prolong the blockchain, bitcoin uses Hashcash puzzles. While Hashcash was designed in 1997 by Adam Back, the original idea was first proposed by Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor and Eli Ponyatovski in their 1992 paper \"Pricing via Processing or Combatting Junk Mail\".\n In 2016, venture capital investment for blockchain-related projects was weakening in the USA but increasing in China.[54] Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies use open (public) blockchains. As of April 2018[update], bitcoin has the highest market capitalization.\n Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network.[55] It has been argued that permissioned blockchains can guarantee a certain level of decentralization, if carefully designed, as opposed to permissionless blockchains, which are often centralized in practice.[11]\n Nikolai Hampton argued in Computerworld that \"There is also no need for a '51 percent' attack on a private blockchain, as the private blockchain (most likely) already controls 100 percent of all block creation resources. If you could attack or damage the blockchain creation tools on a private corporate server, you could effectively control 100 percent of their network and alter transactions however you wished.\"[10] This has a set of particularly profound adverse implications during a financial crisis or debt crisis like the financial crisis of 2007–08, where politically powerful actors may make decisions that favor some groups at the expense of others,[56] and \"the bitcoin blockchain is protected by the massive group mining effort. It's unlikely that any private blockchain will try to protect records using gigawatts of computing power — it's time-consuming and expensive.\"[10] He also said, \"Within a private blockchain there is also no 'race'; there's no incentive to use more power or discover blocks faster than competitors. This means that many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases.\"[10]\n The analysis of public blockchains has become increasingly important with the popularity of bitcoin, Ethereum, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies.[57] A blockchain, if it is public, provides anyone who wants access to observe and analyse the chain data, given one has the know-how. The process of understanding and accessing the flow of crypto has been an issue for many cryptocurrencies, crypto exchanges and banks.[58][59] The reason for this is accusations of blockchain-enabled cryptocurrencies enabling illicit dark market trading of drugs, weapons, money laundering, etc.[60] A common belief has been that cryptocurrency is private and untraceable, thus leading many actors to use it for illegal purposes. This is changing now that specialised tech companies provide blockchain tracking services, making crypto exchanges, law-enforcement and banks more aware of what is happening with crypto funds and fiat-crypto exchanges. The development, some argue, has led criminals to prioritise the use of new cryptos such as Monero.[61][62][63]\n In April 2016, Standards Australia submitted a proposal to the International Organization for Standardization to consider developing standards to support blockchain technology. This proposal resulted in the creation of ISO Technical Committee 307, Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technologies.[64] The technical committee has working groups relating to blockchain terminology, reference architecture, security and privacy, identity, smart contracts, governance and interoperability for blockchain and DLT, as well as standards specific to industry sectors and generic government requirements.[65][non-primary source needed] More than 50 countries are participating in the standardization process together with external liaisons such as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), the European Commission, the International Federation of Surveyors, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE).[65]\n Many other national standards bodies and open standards bodies are also working on blockchain standards.[66] These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology[67] (NIST), the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization[68] (CENELEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers[69] (IEEE), the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS), and some individual participants in the Internet Engineering Task Force[70] (IETF).\n Although most of blockchain implementation are decentralized and distributed, Oracle launched a centralized blockchain table feature in Oracle 21c database. The Blockchain Table in Oracle 21c database is a centralized blockchain which provide immutable feature. Compared to decentralized blockchains, centralized blockchains normally can provide a higher throughput and lower latency of transactions than consensus-based distributed blockchains.[71][72]\n Currently, there are at least four types of blockchain networks — public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.\n A public blockchain has absolutely no access restrictions. Anyone with an Internet connection can send transactions to it as well as become a validator (i.e., participate in the execution of a consensus protocol).[73][self-published source?] Usually, such networks offer economic incentives for those who secure them and utilize some type of a proof-of-stake or proof-of-work algorithm.\n Some of the largest, most known public blockchains are the bitcoin blockchain and the Ethereum blockchain.\n A private blockchain is permissioned.[55] One cannot join it unless invited by the network administrators. Participant and validator access is restricted. To distinguish between open blockchains and other peer-to-peer decentralized database applications that are not open ad-hoc compute clusters, the terminology Distributed Ledger (DLT) is normally used for private blockchains.\n A hybrid blockchain has a combination of centralized and decentralized features.[74] The exact workings of the chain can vary based on which portions of centralization and decentralization are used.\n A sidechain is a designation for a blockchain ledger that runs in parallel to a primary blockchain.[75][76] Entries from the primary blockchain (where said entries typically represent digital assets) can be linked to and from the sidechain; this allows the sidechain to otherwise operate independently of the primary blockchain (e.g., by using an alternate means of record keeping, alternate consensus algorithm, etc.).[77][better source needed]\n A consortium blockchain is a type of blockchain that combines elements of both public and private blockchains. In a consortium blockchain, a group of organizations come together to create and operate the blockchain, rather than a single entity. The consortium members jointly manage the blockchain network and are responsible for validating transactions. Consortium blockchains are permissioned, meaning that only certain individuals or organizations are allowed to participate in the network. This allows for greater control over who can access the blockchain and helps to ensure that sensitive information is kept confidential.\n Consortium blockchains are commonly used in industries where multiple organizations need to collaborate on a common goal, such as supply chain management or financial services. One advantage of consortium blockchains is that they can be more efficient and scalable than public blockchains, as the number of nodes required to validate transactions is typically smaller. Additionally, consortium blockchains can provide greater security and reliability than private blockchains, as the consortium members work together to maintain the network. Some examples of consortium blockchains include Quorum and Hyperledger.[78]\n Blockchain technology can be integrated into multiple areas. The primary use of blockchains is as a distributed ledger for cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin; there were also a few other operational products that had matured from proof of concept by late 2016.[54] As of 2016, some businesses have been testing the technology and conducting low-level implementation to gauge blockchain's effects on organizational efficiency in their back office.[79]\n Blockchain is seen as a pivotal technological advancement of the 21st century, with the ability to impact organizations at strategic, operational, and market levels.[80] In 2019, it was estimated that around $2.9 billion were invested in blockchain technology, which represents an 89% increase from the year prior. Additionally, the International Data Corp estimated that corporate investment into blockchain technology would reach $12.4 billion by 2022.[81] Furthermore, According to PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the second-largest professional services network in the world, blockchain technology has the potential to generate an annual business value of more than $3 trillion by 2030. PwC's estimate is further augmented by a 2018 study that they have conducted, in which PwC surveyed 600 business executives and determined that 84% have at least some exposure to utilizing blockchain technology, which indicates a significant demand and interest in blockchain technology.[82]\n In 2019, the BBC World Service radio and podcast series Fifty Things That Made the Modern Economy identified blockchain as a technology that would have far-reaching consequences for economics and society. The economist and Financial Times journalist and broadcaster Tim Harford discussed why the underlying technology might have much wider applications and the challenges that needed to be overcome.[83] His first broadcast was on 29 June 2019.\n The number of blockchain wallets quadrupled to 40 million between 2016 and 2020.[84]\n A paper published in 2022 discussed the potential use of blockchain technology in sustainable management.[85]\n Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example, the bitcoin network and Ethereum network are both based on blockchain.\n The criminal enterprise Silk Road, which operated on Tor, utilized cryptocurrency for payments, some of which the US federal government seized through research on the blockchain and forfeiture.[86]\n Governments have mixed policies on the legality of their citizens or banks owning cryptocurrencies. China implements blockchain technology in several industries including a national digital currency which launched in 2020.[87] To strengthen their respective currencies, Western governments including the European Union and the United States have initiated similar projects.[88]\n Blockchain-based smart contracts are contracts that can be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction.[89] One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. A key feature of smart contracts is that they do not need a trusted third party (such as a trustee) to act as an intermediary between contracting entities — the blockchain network executes the contract on its own. This may reduce friction between entities when transferring value and could subsequently open the door to a higher level of transaction automation.[90] An IMF staff discussion from 2018 reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general, but \"no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged.\" Due to the lack of widespread use, their legal status was unclear.[91][92]\n According to Reason, many banks have expressed interest in implementing distributed ledgers for use in banking and are cooperating with companies creating private blockchains;[93][94][95] according to a September 2016 IBM study, it is occurring faster than expected.[96] It has been estimated by the World Economic Forum that by 2025, 10% of the world's GDP will be stored on blockchain related technology.[80]\n Banks are interested in this technology not least because it has the potential to speed up back office settlement systems.[97] Moreover, as the blockchain industry has reached early maturity institutional appreciation has grown that it is, practically speaking, the infrastructure of a whole new financial industry, with all the implications which that entails.[98] This technology will transform financial transactions due to its ability to enhance data storage, process simultaneous transactions, lessen transaction costs, and improve capital market transparency for debt and equity capital administration.[80]\n Banks such as UBS are opening new research labs dedicated to blockchain technology in order to explore how blockchain can be used in financial services to increase efficiency and reduce costs.[99][100]\n Berenberg, a German bank, believes that blockchain is an \"overhyped technology\" that has had a large number of \"proofs of concept\", but still has major challenges, and very few success stories.[101]\n The blockchain has also given rise to initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as a new category of digital asset called security token offerings (STOs), also sometimes referred to as digital security offerings (DSOs).[102] STO/DSOs may be conducted privately or on public, regulated stock exchange and are used to tokenize traditional assets such as company shares as well as more innovative ones like intellectual property, real estate,[103] art, or individual products. A number of companies are active in this space providing services for compliant tokenization, private STOs, and public STOs.\n Blockchain technology, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has been used in video games for monetization. Many live-service games offer in-game customization options, such as character skins or other in-game items, which the players can earn and trade with other players using in-game currency. Some games also allow for trading of virtual items using real-world currency, but this may be illegal in some countries where video games are seen as akin to gambling, and has led to gray market issues such as skin gambling, and thus publishers typically have shied away from allowing players to earn real-world funds from games.[104] Blockchain games typically allow players to trade these in-game items for cryptocurrency, which can then be exchanged for money.[105]\n The first known game to use blockchain technologies was CryptoKitties, launched in November 2017, where the player would purchase NFTs with Ethereum cryptocurrency, each NFT consisting of a virtual pet that the player could breed with others to create offspring with combined traits as new NFTs.[106][105] The game made headlines in December 2017 when one virtual pet sold for more than US$100,000.[107] CryptoKitties also illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network in early 2018 with approximately 30% of all Ethereum transactions[clarification needed] being for the game.[108][109]\n By the early 2020s, there had not been a breakout success in video games using blockchain, as these games tend to focus on using blockchain for speculation instead of more traditional forms of gameplay, which offers limited appeal to most players. Such games also represent a high risk to investors as their revenues can be difficult to predict.[105] However, limited successes of some games, such as Axie Infinity during the COVID-19 pandemic, and corporate plans towards metaverse content, refueled interest in the area of GameFi, a term describing the intersection of video games and financing typically backed by blockchain currency, in the second half of 2021.[110] Several major publishers, including Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, and Take Two Interactive, have stated that blockchain and NFT-based games are under serious consideration for their companies in the future.[111]\n In October 2021, Valve Corporation banned blockchain games, including those using cryptocurrency and NFTs, from being hosted on its Steam digital storefront service, which is widely used for personal computer gaming, claiming that this was an extension of their policy banning games that offered in-game items with real-world value. Valve's prior history with gambling, specifically skin gambling, was speculated to be a factor in the decision to ban blockchain games.[112] Journalists and players responded positively to Valve's decision as blockchain and NFT games have a reputation for scams and fraud among most PC gamers,[104][112] and Epic Games, which runs the Epic Games Store in competition to Steam, said that they would be open to accepted blockchain games in the wake of Valve's refusal.[113]\n There have been several different efforts to employ blockchains in supply chain management.\n There are several different efforts to offer domain name services via the blockchain. These domain names can be controlled by the use of a private key, which purports to allow for uncensorable websites. This would also bypass a registrar's ability to suppress domains used for fraud, abuse, or illegal content.[121]\n Namecoin is a cryptocurrency that supports the \".bit\" top-level domain (TLD). Namecoin was forked from bitcoin in 2011. The .bit TLD is not sanctioned by ICANN, instead requiring an alternative DNS root.[121] As of 2015, .bit was used by 28 websites, out of 120,000 registered names.[122] Namecoin was dropped by OpenNIC in 2019, due to malware and potential other legal issues.[123] Other blockchain alternatives to ICANN include The Handshake Network,[122] EmerDNS, and Unstoppable Domains.[121]\n Specific TLDs include \".eth\", \".luxe\", and \".kred\", which are associated with the Ethereum blockchain through the Ethereum Name Service (ENS). The .kred TLD also acts as an alternative to conventional cryptocurrency wallet addresses as a convenience for transferring cryptocurrency.[124]\n \nBlockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users[125] or musicians.[126] The Gartner 2019 CIO Survey reported 2% of higher education respondents had launched blockchain projects and another 18% were planning academic projects in the next 24 months.[127] In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution.[128] Imogen Heap's Mycelia service has also been proposed as a blockchain-based alternative \"that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians.\"[129][130]\n New distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain.[131][132] The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers.[133] The use of blockchain in libraries is being studied with a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services.[134]\n Other blockchain designs include Hyperledger, a collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM).[135][136][137] Another is Quorum, a permissioned private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage, used for contract applications.[138]\n Oracle introduced a blockchain table feature in its Oracle 21c database.[71][72]\n Blockchain is also being used in peer-to-peer energy trading.[139][140][141]\n Lightweight blockchains, or simplified blockchains, are more suitable for internet of things (IoT) applications than conventional blockchains.[142] One experiment suggested that a lightweight blockchain-based network could accommodate up to 1.34 million authentication processes every second, which could be sufficient for resource-constrained IoT networks.[143]\n Blockchain could be used in detecting counterfeits by associating unique identifiers to products, documents and shipments, and storing records associated with transactions that cannot be forged or altered.[144][145] It is however argued that blockchain technology needs to be supplemented with technologies that provide a strong binding between physical objects and blockchain systems,[146] as well as provisions for content creator verification ala KYC standards.[147] The EUIPO established an Anti-Counterfeiting Blockathon Forum, with the objective of \"defining, piloting and implementing\" an anti-counterfeiting infrastructure at the European level.[148][149] The Dutch Standardisation organisation NEN uses blockchain together with QR Codes to authenticate certificates.[150]\n Beijing and Shanghai are among the cities designated by China to trial blockchain applications as January 30, 2022.[151] In Chinese legal proceedings, blockchain technology was first accepted as a method for authenticating internet evidence by the Hangzhou Internet Court in 2019 and has since been accepted by other Chinese courts.[152]: 123–125 \n With the increasing number of blockchain systems appearing, even only those that support cryptocurrencies, blockchain interoperability is becoming a topic of major importance. The objective is to support transferring assets from one blockchain system to another blockchain system. Wegner[153] stated that \"interoperability is the ability of two or more software components to cooperate despite differences in language, interface, and execution platform\". The objective of blockchain interoperability is therefore to support such cooperation among blockchain systems, despite those kinds of differences.\n There are already several blockchain interoperability solutions available.[154] They can be classified into three categories: cryptocurrency interoperability approaches, blockchain engines, and blockchain connectors.\n Several individual IETF participants produced the draft of a blockchain interoperability architecture.[155]\n Some cryptocurrencies use blockchain mining — the peer-to-peer computer computations by which transactions are validated and verified. This requires a large amount of energy. In June 2018, the Bank for International Settlements criticized the use of public proof-of-work blockchains for their high energy consumption.[156][157][158]\n Early concern over the high energy consumption was a factor in later blockchains such as Cardano (2017), Solana (2020) and Polkadot (2020) adopting the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake model. Researchers have estimated that bitcoin consumes 100,000 times as much energy as proof-of-stake networks.[159][160]\n In 2021, a study by Cambridge University determined that bitcoin (at 121 terawatt-hours per year) used more electricity than Argentina (at 121TWh) and the Netherlands (109TWh).[161] According to Digiconomist, one bitcoin transaction required 708 kilowatt-hours of electrical energy, the amount an average U.S. household consumed in 24 days.[162]\n In February 2021, U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen called bitcoin \"an extremely inefficient way to conduct transactions\", saying \"the amount of energy consumed in processing those transactions is staggering\".[163] In March 2021, Bill Gates stated that \"Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind\", adding \"It's not a great climate thing.\"[164]\n Nicholas Weaver, of the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, examined blockchain's online security, and the energy efficiency of proof-of-work public blockchains, and in both cases found it grossly inadequate.[165][166] The 31TWh-45TWh of electricity used for bitcoin in 2018 produced 17-23 million tonnes of CO2.[167][168] By 2022, the University of Cambridge and Digiconomist estimated that the two largest proof-of-work blockchains, bitcoin and Ethereum, together used twice as much electricity in one year as the whole of Sweden, leading to the release of up to 120 million tonnes of CO2 each year.[169]\n Some cryptocurrency developers are considering moving from the proof-of-work model to the proof-of-stake model.[170] In Sept, 2022, Ethereum converted from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.[171]\n In October 2014, the MIT Bitcoin Club, with funding from MIT alumni, provided undergraduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology access to $100 of bitcoin. The adoption rates, as studied by Catalini and Tucker (2016), revealed that when people who typically adopt technologies early are given delayed access, they tend to reject the technology.[172] Many universities have founded departments focusing on crypto and blockchain, including MIT, in 2017. In the same year, Edinburgh became \"one of the first big European universities to launch a blockchain course\", according to the Financial Times.[173]\n Motivations for adopting blockchain technology (an aspect of innovation adoption) have been investigated by researchers. For example, Janssen, et al. provided a framework for analysis,[174] and Koens & Poll pointed out that adoption could be heavily driven by non-technical factors.[175] Based on behavioral models, Li[176] has discussed the differences between adoption at the individual level and organizational levels.\n Scholars in business and management have started studying the role of blockchains to support collaboration.[177][178] It has been argued that blockchains can foster both cooperation (i.e., prevention of opportunistic behavior) and coordination (i.e., communication and information sharing). Thanks to reliability, transparency, traceability of records, and information immutability, blockchains facilitate collaboration in a way that differs both from the traditional use of contracts and from relational norms. Contrary to contracts, blockchains do not directly rely on the legal system to enforce agreements.[179] In addition, contrary to the use of relational norms, blockchains do not require a trust or direct connections between collaborators.\n The need for internal audits to provide effective oversight of organizational efficiency will require a change in the way that information is accessed in new formats.[181] Blockchain adoption requires a framework to identify the risk of exposure associated with transactions using blockchain. The Institute of Internal Auditors has identified the need for internal auditors to address this transformational technology. New methods are required to develop audit plans that identify threats and risks. The Internal Audit Foundation study, Blockchain and Internal Audit, assesses these factors.[182] The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has outlined new roles for auditors as a result of blockchain.[183]\n In September 2015, the first peer-reviewed academic journal dedicated to cryptocurrency and blockchain technology research, Ledger, was announced. The inaugural issue was published in December 2016.[184] The journal covers aspects of mathematics, computer science, engineering, law, economics and philosophy that relate to cryptocurrencies.[185][186] The journal encourages authors to digitally sign a file hash of submitted papers, which are then timestamped into the bitcoin blockchain. Authors are also asked to include a personal bitcoin address on the first page of their papers for non-repudiation purposes.[187]\n",

        "content": "\n Bitcoin (abbreviation: BTC; sign: ₿) is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Based on a free-market ideology, bitcoin was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto, an unknown person.[5] Use of bitcoin as a currency began in 2009,[6] with the release of its open-source implementation.[7]: ch. 1  In 2021, El Salvador adopted it as legal tender.[4] It is mostly seen as an investment and has been described by some scholars as an economic bubble.[8] As bitcoin is pseudonymous, its use by criminals has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to its ban by several countries as of 2021[update].[9]\n Nodes in the peer-to-peer bitcoin network verify transactions through cryptography and record them in a public distributed ledger, called a blockchain, without central oversight. Consensus between nodes is achieved using a computationally intensive process based on proof of work, called mining, that secures the bitcoin blockchain. Mining consumes large quantities of electricity and has been criticized for its environmental impact.[10]\n Before bitcoin, several digital cash technologies were released, starting with David Chaum's ecash in the 1980s.[11] The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992.[12][11] The concept was independently rediscovered by Adam Back who developed Hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997.[11] The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies came from cypherpunks Wei Dai (b-money) and Nick Szabo (bit gold) in 1998.[13] In 2004, Hal Finney developed the first currency based on reusable proof of work.[14] These various attempts were not successful:[11] Chaum's concept required centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on, Hashcash had no protection against double-spending, while b-money and bit gold were not resistant to Sybil attacks.[11]\n The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008.[15] On 31 October 2008, a link to a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list.[16] Nakamoto implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.[6] Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.[5] According to computer scientist Arvind Narayanan, all individual components of bitcoin originated in earlier academic literature.[11] Nakamoto's innovation was their complex interplay resulting in the first decentralized, Sybil resistant, Byzantine fault tolerant digital cash system, that would eventually be referred to as the first blockchain.[11][17] Nakamoto's paper was not peer reviewed and was initially ignored by academics, who argued that it could not work.[11]\n On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the chain, known as the genesis block.[18] Embedded in this block was the text \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\", which is the date and headline of an issue of The Times newspaper.[6] Nine days later, Hal Finney received the first bitcoin transaction: ten bitcoins from Nakamoto.[19] Wei Dai and Nick Szabo were also early supporters.[18] On May 22, 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bought two Papa John's pizzas for ₿10,000, in what would later be celebrated as \"Bitcoin Pizza Day\".[20]\n Blockchain analysts estimate that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins[21] before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to Gavin Andresen. Andresen later became lead developer at the Bitcoin Foundation,[22][23] an organization founded in September 2012 to promote bitcoin.[24]\n After early \"proof-of-concept\" transactions, the first major users of bitcoin were black markets, such as the dark web Silk Road. During its 30 months of existence, beginning in February 2011, Silk Road exclusively accepted bitcoins as payment, transacting ₿9.9 million, worth about $214 million.[25]: 222 \n In March 2013, the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) established regulatory guidelines for \"decentralized virtual currencies\" such as bitcoin, classifying American bitcoin miners who sell their generated bitcoins as money services businesses, subject to registration and other legal obligations.[26] In May 2013, US authorities seized the unregistered exchange Mt. Gox.[27] In June 2013, the US Drug Enforcement Administration seized ₿11.02 from a man attempting to use them to buy illegal substances. This marked the first time a government agency had seized bitcoins.[28] The FBI seized about ₿30,000 in October 2013 from Silk Road, following the arrest of its founder Ross Ulbricht.[29]\n In December 2013, the People's Bank of China prohibited Chinese financial institutions from using bitcoin.[30] After the announcement, the value of bitcoin dropped,[31] and Baidu no longer accepted bitcoins for certain services.[32] Buying real-world goods with any virtual currency had been illegal in China since at least 2009.[33]\n Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, most of them using bitcoin.[34] In August 2017, the SegWit software upgrade was activated. Segwit was intended to support the Lightning Network as well as improve scalability.[35] SegWit opponents, who supported larger blocks as a scalability solution, forked to create Bitcoin Cash, one of many forks of bitcoin.[36]\n In December 2017, the first futures on bitcoin was introduced by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).[37]\n In February 2018, the price crashed after China imposed a complete ban on bitcoin trading.[38] The percentage of bitcoin trading in the Chinese renminbi fell from over 90% in September 2017 to less than 1% in June 2018.[39] During the same year, bitcoin prices were negatively affected by several hacks or thefts from cryptocurrency exchanges.[40]\n In 2020, some major companies and institutions started to acquire bitcoin: MicroStrategy invested $250 million in bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset,[42] Square, Inc., $50 million,[43] and MassMutual, $100 million.[44] In November 2020, PayPal added support for bitcoin in the US.[45]\n In February 2021, bitcoin's market capitalization reached $1 trillion for the first time.[46] In November 2021, the Taproot soft-fork upgrade was activated, adding support for Schnorr signatures, improved functionality of smart contracts and Lightning Network.[47] Before, bitcoin only used a custom elliptic curve with the ECDSA algorithm to produce signatures.[48]: 101  In September 2021, bitcoin became legal tender in El Salvador, alongside the US dollar.[4] In October 2021, the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF), called BITO, from ProShares was approved by the SEC and listed on the CME.[49]\n In May and June 2022, the bitcoin price fell following the collapses of TerraUSD, a stablecoin,[50] and the Celsius Network, a cryptocurrency loan company.[51][52]\n In 2023, ordinals—non-fungible tokens (NFTs)—on bitcoin, went live.[53] As of June 2023, River Financial estimated that bitcoin had 81.7 million users, about 1% of the global population.[54] In January 2024, the first 11 US spot bitcoin ETFs began trading, offering direct exposure to bitcoin for the first time on American stock exchanges.[55][56] In December 2024, bitcoin price reached $100,000 for the first time, as US president-elect Donald Trump promised to make the US the \"crypto capital of the planet\" and to stockpile bitcoin.[57] The same month, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, recommended investors to allocate up to 2% of their portfolio to bitcoin.[58]\n The unit of account of the bitcoin system is the bitcoin. It is most commonly represented with the symbol ₿[1] and the currency code BTC. However, the BTC code does not conform to ISO 4217 as BT is the country code of Bhutan,[59] and ISO 4217 requires the first letter used in global commodities to be 'X'.[59] XBT, a code that conforms to ISO 4217 though not officially part of it,[59] is used by Bloomberg L.P.[60]\n No uniform capitalization convention exists; some sources use Bitcoin, capitalized, to refer to the technology and network, and bitcoin, lowercase, for the unit of account.[61] The Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary and the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary use the capitalized and lowercase variants without distinction.[62][63]\n One bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places.[7]: ch. 5  Units for smaller amounts of bitcoin are the millibitcoin (mBTC), equal to 1⁄1000 bitcoin, and the satoshi[a] (sat), representing 1⁄100000000 (one hundred millionth) bitcoin, the smallest amount possible.[2] 100,000 satoshis are one mBTC.[64]\n As a decentralized system, bitcoin operates without a central authority or single administrator,[65] so that anyone can create a new bitcoin address and transact without needing any approval.[7]: ch. 1  This is accomplished through a specialized distributed ledger called a blockchain that records bitcoin transactions.[66]\n The blockchain is implemented as an ordered list of blocks. Each block contains a SHA-256 hash of the previous block,[66] chaining them in chronological order.[7]: ch. 7 [66] The blockchain is maintained by a peer-to-peer network.[25]: 215–219  Individual blocks, public addresses, and transactions within blocks are public information, and can be examined using a blockchain explorer.[67]\n Nodes validate and broadcast transactions, each maintaining a copy of the blockchain for ownership verification.[68] A new block is created every 10 minutes on average, updating the blockchain across all nodes without central oversight. This process tracks bitcoin spending, ensuring each bitcoin is spent only once. Unlike a traditional ledger that tracks physical currency, bitcoins exist digitally as unspent outputs of transactions.[7]: ch. 5 \n In the blockchain, bitcoins are linked to specific addresses that are hashes of a public key. Creating an address involves generating a random private key and then computing the corresponding address. This process is almost instant, but the reverse (finding the private key for a given address) is nearly impossible.[7]: ch. 4  Publishing a bitcoin address does not risk its private key, and it is extremely unlikely to accidentally generate a used key with funds. To use bitcoins, owners need their private key to digitally sign transactions, which are verified by the network using the public key, keeping the private key secret.[7]: ch. 5 \n Bitcoin transactions use a Forth-like scripting language,[7]: ch. 5  involving one or more inputs and outputs. When sending bitcoins, a user specifies the recipients' addresses and the amount for each output. This allows sending bitcoins to several recipients in a single transaction. To prevent double-spending, each input must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain.[69] Using multiple inputs is similar to using multiple coins in a cash transaction. As in a cash transaction, the sum of inputs can exceed the intended sum of payments. In such a case, an additional output can return the change back to the payer.[69] Unallocated input satoshis in the transaction become the transaction fee.[69]\n Losing a private key means losing access to the bitcoins, with no other proof of ownership accepted by the protocol.[25] For instance, in 2013, a user lost ₿7,500, valued at US$7.5 million, by accidentally discarding a hard drive with the private key.[70] It is estimated that around 20% of all bitcoins are lost.[71] The private key must also be kept secret as its exposure, such as through a data breach, can lead to theft of the associated bitcoins.[7]: ch. 10 [72] As of December 2017[update], approximately ₿980,000 had been stolen from cryptocurrency exchanges.[73]\n The mining process in bitcoin involves maintaining the blockchain through computer processing power. Miners group and broadcast new transactions into blocks, which are then verified by the network.[66] Each block must contain a proof of work (PoW) to be accepted,[66] involving finding a nonce number that, combined with the block content, produces a hash numerically smaller than the network's difficulty target.[7]: ch. 8  This PoW is simple to verify but hard to generate, requiring many attempts.[7]: ch. 8  PoW forms the basis of bitcoin's consensus mechanism.[74]\n The difficulty of generating a block is deterministically adjusted based on the mining power on the network by changing the difficulty target, which is recalibrated every 2,016 blocks (approximately two weeks) to maintain an average time of ten minutes between new blocks. The process requires significant computational power and specialized hardware.[7]: ch. 8 [75]\n Miners who successfully find a new block can collect transaction fees from the included transactions and a set reward in bitcoins.[76] To claim this reward, a special transaction called a coinbase is included in the block, with the miner as the payee. All bitcoins in existence have been created through this type of transaction.[7]: ch. 8  This reward is halved every 210,000 blocks until ₿21 million,[b] with new bitcoin issuance slated to end around 2140. Afterward, miners will only earn from transaction fees. These fees are determined by the transaction's size and the amount of data stored, measured in satoshis per byte.[77][69][7]: ch. 8 \n The proof of work system and the chaining of blocks make blockchain modifications very difficult, as altering one block requires changing all subsequent blocks. As more blocks are added, modifying older blocks becomes increasingly challenging.[78][66] In case of disagreement, nodes trust the longest chain, which required the greatest amount of effort to produce.[74] To tamper or censor the ledger, one needs to control the majority of the global hashrate.[74] The high cost required to reach this level of computational power secures the bitcoin blockchain.[74]\n Bitcoin mining's environmental impact is controversial and has attracted the attention of regulators, leading to restrictions or incentives in various jurisdictions.[79] As of 2022[update], a non-peer-reviewed study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) estimated that bitcoin mining represented 0.4% of global electricity consumption.[80] Another 2022 non-peer-reviewed commentary published in Joule estimated that bitcoin mining was responsible for 0.2% of world greenhouse gas emissions.[81] About half of the electricity used is generated through fossil fuels.[82] Moreover, mining hardware's short lifespan results in electronic waste.[83] The amount of electrical energy consumed, and the e-waste generated, is comparable to that of Greece and the Netherlands, respectively.[83][81]\n Bitcoin is pseudonymous, with funds linked to addresses, not real-world identities. While the owners of these addresses are not directly identified, all transactions are public on the blockchain. Patterns of use, like spending coins from multiple inputs, can hint at a common owner. Public data can sometimes be matched with known address owners.[84] Bitcoin exchanges might also need to collect personal data as per legal requirements.[85] For enhanced privacy, users can generate a new address for each transaction.[86]\n In the bitcoin network, each bitcoin is treated equally, ensuring basic fungibility. However, users and applications can choose to differentiate between bitcoins. While wallets and software treat all bitcoins the same, each bitcoin's transaction history is recorded on the blockchain. This public record allows for chain analysis, where users can identify and potentially reject bitcoins from controversial sources.[87] For example, in 2012, Mt. Gox froze accounts containing bitcoins identified as stolen.[88]\n Bitcoin wallets were the first cryptocurrency wallets, enabling users to store the information necessary to transact bitcoins.[89][7]: ch. 1, glossary  The first wallet program, simply named Bitcoin, and sometimes referred to as the Satoshi client, was released in 2009 by Nakamoto as open-source software.[6] Bitcoin Core is among the best known clients. Forks of Bitcoin Core exist such as Bitcoin Unlimited.[90] Wallets can be full clients, with a full copy of the blockchain to check the validity of mined blocks,[7]: ch. 1  or lightweight clients, just to send and receive transactions without a local copy of the entire blockchain.[91] Third-party internet services called online wallets store users' credentials on their servers, making them susceptible of hacks.[92] Cold storage protects bitcoins from such hacks by keeping private keys offline, either through specialized hardware wallets or paper printouts.[93][7]: ch. 4 \n Nakamoto limited the block size to one megabyte.[94] The limited block size and frequency can lead to delayed processing of transactions, increased fees and a bitcoin scalability problem.[95] The Lightning Network, second-layer routing network, is a potential scaling solution.[7]: ch. 8 \n Research shows a trend towards centralization in bitcoin as miners join pools for stable income.[25]: 215, 219–222 [96]: 3  If a single miner or pool controls more than 50% of the hashing power, it would allow them to censor transactions and double-spend coins.[65] In 2014, mining pool Ghash.io reached 51% mining power, causing safety concerns, but later voluntarily capped its power at 39.99% for the benefit of the whole network.[97] A few entities also dominate other parts of the ecosystem such as the client software, online wallets, and simplified payment verification (SPV) clients.[65]\n According to the European Central Bank, the decentralization of money offered by bitcoin has its theoretical roots in the Austrian school of economics, especially with Friedrich Hayek's The Denationalisation of Money, in which he advocates a complete free market in the production, distribution and management of money to end the monopoly of central banks.[98]: 22  Sociologist Nigel Dodd argues that the essence of the bitcoin ideology is to remove money from social, as well as governmental, control.[99] The Economist describes bitcoin as \"a techno-anarchist project to create an online version of cash, a way for people to transact without the possibility of interference from malicious governments or banks\".[100] These philosophical ideas initially attracted libertarians and anarchists.[101] Economist Paul Krugman argues that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are only used by bank skeptics and criminals.[102]\n Money serves three purposes: a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account.[103] According to The Economist in 2014, bitcoin functions best as a medium of exchange.[103] In 2015, The Economist noted that bitcoins had three qualities useful in a currency: they are \"hard to earn, limited in supply and easy to verify\".[104] However, a 2018 assessment by The Economist stated that cryptocurrencies met none of these three criteria.[100] Per some researchers, as of 2015[update], bitcoin functions more as a payment system than as a currency.[25] In 2014, economist Robert J. Shiller wrote that bitcoin has potential as a unit of account for measuring the relative value of goods, as with Chile's Unidad de Fomento, but that \"Bitcoin in its present form... doesn't really solve any sensible economic problem\".[105] François R. Velde, Senior Economist at the Chicago Fed, described bitcoin as \"an elegant solution to the problem of creating a digital currency\".[106] David Andolfatto, Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, stated that bitcoin is a threat to the establishment, which he argues is a good thing for the Federal Reserve System and other central banks, because it prompts these institutions to operate sound policies.[107]\n The legal status of bitcoin varies substantially from one jurisdiction to another. Because of its decentralized nature and its global presence, regulating bitcoin is difficult. However, the use of bitcoin can be criminalized, and shutting down exchanges and the peer-to-peer economy in a given country would constitute a de facto ban.[108] The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators, legislative bodies, and law enforcement.[109] Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz says that bitcoin's anonymity encourages money laundering and other crimes.[110] This is the main justification behind bitcoin bans.[9] As of November 2021[update], nine countries applied an absolute ban (Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, and Tunisia) while another 42 countries had an implicit ban.[111][needs update] Bitcoin is only legal tender in El Salvador.[4]\n As of 2018[update], bitcoin is rarely used in transactions with merchants,[112] but it is popular to purchase illegal goods online.[113][114] Prices are not usually quoted in bitcoin and trades involve conversions into fiat currencies.[25] Commonly cited reasons for not using bitcoin include high costs, the inability to process chargebacks, high price volatility, long transaction times, and transaction fees (especially for small purchases).[112][115] Bloomberg reported that bitcoin was being used for large-item purchases on the site Overstock.com and for cross-border payments to freelancers.[116] As of 2015[update], there was little sign of bitcoin use in international remittances despite high fees charged by banks and Western Union who compete in this market.[25][117] Despite associated risks and costs, in 2022, a growing use of bitcoin, alongside cash and cards, was reported in restaurant business.[118]\n In September 2021, the Bitcoin Law made bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, alongside the US dollar.[4] The adoption has been criticized internationally and within El Salvador.[4][119] In 2022, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged El Salvador to reverse its decision.[120] As of 2022[update], the use of Bitcoin in El Salvador remains low: 80% of businesses refused to accept it.[121] In April 2022, the Central African Republic (CAR) adopted bitcoin as legal tender alongside the CFA franc,[122] but repealed the reform one year later.[123]\n Bitcoin is also used by some governments. For instance, the Iranian government initially opposed cryptocurrencies, but later saw them as an opportunity to circumvent sanctions.[124] Since 2020, Iran has required local bitcoin miners to sell bitcoin to the Central Bank of Iran, allowing the central bank to use it for imports.[125] Some constituent states also accept tax payments in bitcoin, including Colorado (US)[126] and Zug (Switzerland).[127] As of 2023, the US government owned more than $5 billion worth of seized bitcoin.[128][129]\n As of 2018[update], the overwhelming majority of bitcoin transactions took place on cryptocurrency exchanges.[112] Since 2014, regulated bitcoin funds also allow exposure to the asset or to futures as an investment.[130][131] Bitcoin is used as a store of value:[132][133] individuals and companies such as the Winklevoss twins[134] and Elon Musk's companies SpaceX and Tesla have massively invested in bitcoin.[135][136] Bitcoin wealth is highly concentrated, with 0.01% holding 27% of in-circulation currency, as of 2021.[137] As of September 2023[update], El Salvador had $76.5 million worth of bitcoin in its international reserves.[138]\n In 2018, research published in the Journal of Monetary Economics concluded that price manipulation occurred during the Mt. Gox bitcoin theft and that the market remained vulnerable to manipulation.[139] Research published in The Journal of Finance also suggested that trading associated with increases in the amount of the Tether cryptocurrency and associated trading at the Bitfinex exchange accounted for about half of the price increase in bitcoin in late 2017.[140][141]\n Bitcoin, along with other cryptocurrencies, has been described as an economic bubble by several economists, including Nobel Prize in Economics laureates, such as Joseph Stiglitz,[142] James Heckman,[8] and Paul Krugman.[102] Another recipient of the prize, Robert Shiller, argues that bitcoin is rather a fad that may become an asset class. He describes its price growth as an \"epidemic\", driven by contagious narratives.[143] In 2024, Jean Tirole, also Nobel laureate, described bitcoin as a \"pure bubble\" as its intrinsic value is zero. According to him, some bubbles are long-lasting such as gold and fiat currencies, and it's impossible to predict whether bitcoin will collapse like other financial bubbles or become the new gold.[144] The same year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell described bitcoin as a digital competitor to gold but not to the dollar as he argued it is a highly volatile speculative asset not used as a form of payment.[145]\n According to research published in the International Review of Financial Analysis in 2018, bitcoin as an asset is highly volatile and does not behave like any other conventional asset.[146] According to one 2022 analysis published in The Journal of Alternative Investments, bitcoin was less volatile than oil, silver, US Treasuries, and 190 stocks in the S&P 500 during and after the 2020 stock market crash.[147] The term hodl was created in December 2013 for holding bitcoin rather than selling it during periods of volatility.[148][149]\n Other economists, investors, and the central bank of Estonia have described bitcoin as a potential Ponzi scheme.[150][151][152] Legal scholar Eric Posner disagrees, however, as \"a real Ponzi scheme takes fraud; bitcoin, by contrast, seems more like a collective delusion\".[153] A 2014 World Bank report also concluded that bitcoin was not a deliberate Ponzi scheme.[154]\n",
